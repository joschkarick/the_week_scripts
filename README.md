# Helper scripts for The Week

The main goal of this tool is to automate some steps of the translation process for theweek.ooo.

# Dependencies
The tool is written in python3, using the following modules:
- PySimpleGUI
- srt
- os
- sys
- docx
- pyinstaller

# How to build
To build a new executable after changing code, use the build_exe.bat. This was only tested on Windows, other OSs might need different commands.
