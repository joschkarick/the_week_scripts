# Helper scripts for The Week

The main goal of this tool is to automate some steps of the translation process for theweek.ooo.

# Current status
The toolset "subtitle_toolset.py" is currently working and ready to use.

# Configuration
The visuals can be configured in the config file "config/subtitle_tool_config.yaml", which will be created at the first run.

# How to build
To build a new executable after changing code, use the build_exetoolset.bat. This was only tested on Windows, other OSs might need different commands.

Be aware of the requirements for your OS: https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/requirements.html#macos
