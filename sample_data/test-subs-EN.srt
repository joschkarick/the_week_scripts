1
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:07,413
Hey everybody.


2
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:08,606
Welcome to
The Week.

3
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:12,968
1, 2, 3, clap.


4
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:16,699
Disaster.

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:18,668
Hello everyone,
welcome to The Week.

6
00:00:18,668 --> 00:00:20,235
Hi and welcome to The Week.


7
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:22,960
Good morning, good afternoon, good evening.


8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,400
Welcome to The Week.


9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,730
Glad you're here.


10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:26,730
My name is Frank Johnson.

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,090
My name is Ashley McClure.

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,160
John and Holly Arbuckle
at Singing Pastures Farm.

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,501
My name is Yancy,
and I'm really glad that you're here.

14
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,866
That is it, the first episode.


15
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:38,418
I really hope you
have a great experience.

16
00:00:38,418 --> 00:00:41,100
I’m so excited that you’re settling in


17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,610
and hope that you enjoy this conversation
that is really meaningful.

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,960
Put on your seatbelts,
because it's going to be a bumpy ride today.

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,461
1, 2, 3.


20
00:00:51,772 --> 00:00:52,772
Perfect.


21
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:54,835
Welcome!


22
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:56,384
Yes. Welcome everyone!


23
00:00:56,821 --> 00:01:00,390
Right now you might be at home
with your friends or your family,

24
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,579
or maybe you're at work with your colleagues.


25
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,549
And yeah, it's exciting for us
to picture you

26
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,660
wherever you are with your group.


27
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,360
And we're grateful
that you decided to join us.

28
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,860
My name is Helene.

29
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,070
And I’m Frederic.

30
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,229
And we’re married, we have two kids.


31
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:17,510
They are 8 and 11.

32
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,030
I’m French,

33
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,729
Fred is from Belgium
where we met years ago.

34
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:24,760
Hence our accents,
so please bear with us.

35
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,890
And we now live in the United States.


36
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:32,490
And three years ago,
we went through a profound shift.

37
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,299
Before that we, we sort of knew that

38
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:37,060
things are in a bad shape
when it comes to, you know,

39
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,720
the climate and the environment.

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,570
But it felt abstract.


41
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,140
Like it didn't really feel like
it had anything to do with our, our own lives.

42
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,700
And plus it felt pretty depressing.


43
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,800
So we kind of, you know, did our best
to tune it out and, and not engage with it.





44
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,969
And then one day
good friends of ours came to visit.

45
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:55,969
[Music]

46
00:01:55,969 --> 00:02:00,500
And we were impressed by their courage
to really grapple with this.

47
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,780
And it made it real for us.

48
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,240
And so when they left, you know,

49
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,840
I remember we looked at each other
and we said like, you know:

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,630
If they have the courage to do this,
we should be able to do it too.

51
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,770
And so when they left,
we had this urge to learn everything we could.

52
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,330
We read and researched
and watched documentaries.

53
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,450
And along the way, we met amazing people


54
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,000
who also had been on a similar journey
to face this reality.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,910
And for us facing this was a real shock.


56
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:33,909
Um, we went on what could best be described
like a U-shaped journey.

57
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:39,130
At first it brought up lots of, you know,
sadness and fear and anger.

58
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,319
But luckily we didn't get stuck there.


59
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,090
We came out on the other side
with lots of energy,

60
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,840
with lots of clarity about what was important
and what we wanted to do with our lives.





61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,390
And after we went through this, uh,


62
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,739
we invited some of our friends
to go on a similar journey.

63
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,260
And you know, this was a pandemic.


64
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,990
So we did it on, on video calls.


65
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,230
Hi, I'm Helene.

66
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,799
Yeah, I'm Frederic.

67
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:03,700
And they liked it so much
that they invited

68
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,909
some of their friends and then their friends.


69
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:07,609
And it started to gather steam.

70
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:10,420
And at some point we figured
let's turn this into films,

71
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,379
make them free and,
and see what happens.

72
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:16,860
[Music grows louder]

73
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,280
And we met this wonderful film team.


74
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,810
And long story short,
here we are, together with you to do this.

75
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,280
And it’s not just us.

76
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,000
Every day, everywhere around the world,

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,100
thousands of people are coming to terms
with what’s happening.

78
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,340
And in this film, you’ll meet a few of them.


79
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,510
Nine people we fell in love with

80
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,700
and who said “yes” when we asked them
if they would share with us and with you





81
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,540
how they came to face this issue
and what they decided to do about it.





82
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,849
So there is Ashley.

83
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:59,709
A family doctor in California.

84
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:03,549
There is Ophélie, in France,
who works in construction.

85
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,720
There’s Frank, in Memphis Tennessee,

86
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,459
who fights the pollution
that has devastated his community.

87
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:12,430
Scarlett, a student and activist in England,


88
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,049
who saw the consequences
of climate change in Kashmir,

89
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:18,699
where her parents are from.

90
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:21,570
We have John and Holly,
9th generation farmers,

91
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,910
who made the leap
to regenerative agriculture.

92
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,630
And also Pauline, in Paris,


93
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,280
who rallied colleagues to make changes
from within her workplace.

94
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,080
Yancy, in Arizona,
an ex-Marine and grandfather

95
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,100
who left the oil industry
to work for an electric truck company.






96
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,360
And finally we have
Peter [English pronunciation]…

97
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,740
or Peter [German pronunciation].

98
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,940
A German lawyer who for 25 years has had
an impressive string of wins in court






99
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,410
to protect our future.

100
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,750
Some of them live in North America,
the others in Europe.

101
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,750
And we focused on these two continents
because we have no lived experience elsewhere.






102
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,910
So we didn’t feel quite qualified to talk
about Asia, South America or Africa.

103
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,810
That that being said, you know,
if you live outside of Europe or the US,

104
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,630
and you want to create a local version of
the week for where you live,

105
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,220
please reach out because
we'd love to help you make it happen.

106
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,830
So, Ashley, Frank, Pauline, Scarlett,

107
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,000
Peter, John, Holly,

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,170
Ophelie, Yancy, us…

109
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,160
We all are really different.

110
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,630
We're different in terms of our age,
our jobs, our politics.

111
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,130
Some of us are religious, others are not.

112
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,710
We're different in how much or little money
we’ve got left at the end of the month.





113
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,919
But we have one thing in common.

114
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,199
Each of us had the courage
to really look into

115
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,440
the environmental breakdown
that’s happening.

116
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,440
And then figured out
what we wanted to do about it.

117
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,380
And this is exactly what we are
inviting you to do with us now.

118
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,860
We’re going to meet three times
over the course of a week.

119
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,610
You know, that's why we called it The Week.


120
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,050
And each time we'll start with
a one hour film,

121
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,830
and then we'll invite you to have
a conversation with your group

122
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,660
for something like 30 to 45 minutes.


123
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,850
So, we'll go through the U together.

124
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:23,440
In episode one, we'll go down the rabbit hole
to really understand the situation we're in.






125
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,099
In episode two, we'll examine
how we got into this mess

126
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:29,229
and what it would take to get out of it.


127
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:33,539
And in episode three,
we'll look into the question

128
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,070
what can I do?

129
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,220
What can we do?


130
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,410
And there's one more person
that we want to introduce to you.

131
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,180
To share with you
everything we learned,

132
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,090
we looked for a narrator,
like they do in films,

133
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,410
somebody with a good voice.


134
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,030
And, and we figured,


135
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,810
instead of hiring some random actor
that we wouldn't know

136
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,250
that we'd ask our friend Seamus, you know,


137
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,050
who lives up the road
and who has a great voice.

138
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,800
La la la.

139
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Yeah.

140
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,810
We've been told
that he speaks good English.

141
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,060
She sells seashells by the seashore.

142
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,150
Aah, don't ask me to do that.

143
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,530
And yeah, all of the research
that Seamus will share,

144
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,129
has been looked over by a conservation
scientist and a climate scientist

145
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:18,530
to make sure that it's really solid


146
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,500
and that it's of course in line with

147
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,770
the consensus of the scientific community.

148
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,460
And if you're interested to go deeper
into any of this:

149
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:33,270
Every time we'll share a fact, you'll see
a little orange dot in the corner of the screen.





150
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,460
Somewhere here for you, I guess.

151
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,460
Um.

152
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,400
And it means that you can look up
the source material on The Week's website.

153
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,020
As for us, you’ll see that sometimes
we’ll be reading from a sheet of paper.

154
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,240
Well, that’s exactly for the same reason:

155
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,650
We want to make sure
we get things as right as possible.

156
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,650
Okay.

157
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:57,379
This being said, today is day one
and it's the hard day.

158
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:00,850
It's where we go down to U together
and, and face what's coming.

159
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,370
You know, if I have a serious illness,


160
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,750
I want to know exactly where I'm at,
so I can do something about it.

161
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,210
And it's the same with this crisis.

162
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:14,820
Like in 10 or 20 or 30 years,
I want to be able to say, I have no regrets.

163
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,560
Like I knew what was coming
and I did what I wanted to do.

164
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,240
And, and that's why we created The Week.


165
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,240
We feel that everyone has a right
to look into this

166
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,729
and then to decide for themselves
what they wanna do about this or not.

167
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:32,840
And if you’re one of the people
who’ve been grappling deeply with this already,

168
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,250
maybe even for years… uh, we invite you
to still go fully into the experience,






169
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,780
and see what might show up for you this time.


170
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,550
[Deep breath] OK.

171
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,500
Let’s jump right in.

172
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
[Music]

173
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,241
We’ve come to understand that the reason

174
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:51,700
most people aren’t terrified
about the environmental crisis

175
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,089
is that we tend to take it in, in pieces.


176
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:59,720
We see floods in the news
or a catastrophic spill somewhere.

177
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,500
It might be shocking, yes,
but we also have to rush to work.

178
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,750
The next day
we might hear about massive wildfires

179
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,550
and how that will happen more and more often
as the world gets warmer.

180
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,380
But then we also have dinner to fix, right?


181
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,140
And it’s not like we don’t know
what’s happening.

182
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,100
But it never comes together
to make a complete picture.

183
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,399
And it’s hard to see how it has anything
to do with our own lives.

184
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,190
And today we don't want to do that.

185
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,220
Today, we want to lay out all the big pieces
on the table like we do with a puzzle.





186
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,589
And then we'll try to assemble it
so that we can take in the big picture.






187
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:37,040
And see, you know,
what's actually there.

188
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,519
Seamus, uh, over to you.

189
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:42,709
The first big piece we will talk about is


190
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,706
how the living world is collapsing
everywhere around the world.

191
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,065
Life is this incredible miracle!

192
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,740
So much beauty that’s been around forever.


193
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,740
We sometimes hear about
one or another species

194
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,370
that is endangered or disappearing.

195
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,760
But most of us don’t realize that it’s
almost every form of life that is declining,

196
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,390
every year a bit more, everywhere on earth.


197
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,779
Let’s look at a few examples.

198
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:19,779
Take birds.

199
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:24,340
In the US, a third of all birds
have disappeared in the past 50 years.

200
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,050
With regards to insects,

201
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,750
the most detailed study ever done,
in Germany,

202
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,130
shows that the speed of disappearance
is even faster!

203
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,310
And they are still declining.

204
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,010
You might remember road trips
from your childhood

205
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,000
with the windshield full of insects,
but that’s no longer the case.





206
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,460
Large fish have disappeared
to an even greater degree.

207
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:47,220
There are only 10% left.

208
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,490
The oceans are almost empty.

209
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,800
Forests?

210
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,860
We lose an area of the size of Italy
every year!

211
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:59,810
The same decline happens with
wetlands, mangroves, corals and topsoil.

212
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,100
So much has disappeared,
in just one or two generations!

213
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,700
And it continues so fast
that in our lifetime,

214
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,680
if we continue on our current trajectory,


215
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,250
in many places, some of these
could dangerously approach zero.

216
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,479
Here is a piece of data that shows
how much life has already vanished.

217
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:22,170
Take all the wild mammals that live
everywhere in this beautiful world.

218
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,954
Separately, let’s take all of
us humans and our livestock.

219
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:30,610
Now let’s imagine we put these two groups
on a scale and compare their weight.

220
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,250
Take a guess:
which group do you think is heavier?

221
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:42,494
We, humans and our livestock, now represent
96% of the mass of all mammals on earth.

222
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:46,575
We've overrun everything else.

223
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:49,654
Wild mammals are down to 4%!

224
00:11:49,654 --> 00:11:52,952
And that’s all that’s left
and they’re still declining.

225
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,905
What we are experiencing right now,

226
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:59,650
scientists call it a “mass extinction”
event,

227
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,800
the 6th mass extinction on earth.

228
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,880
I remember in high school learning about
the 5 mass extinctions that have happened,

229
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,970
millions of years ago, and,
and wiped out most of life.

230
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,130
It's mind blowing when I read and, and,


231
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,490
and try to grapple with the fact
that I am now,

232
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,100
that we are now in the middle of,

233
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,399
there is no other term for it...

234
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,960
we are in the middle of a mass extinction.



235
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,710
There comes a moment where we push this
so far that it boomerangs back at us.





236
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:33,080
I don't know if you've played
the game Kerplunk when you were little,

237
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:39,089
but it's a good way to visualize
how these extinctions relate to us.

238
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:42,450
In the game, you take turns
taking out a stick.

239
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,769
The goal is to not let the marbles fall.


240
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:47,870
Imagine for a second
that each marble is a species.

241
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,269
Insects, birds, trees.

242
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,430
Everything that makes up an ecosystem.

243
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,149
One of the marbles is us, humans.

244
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,900
Every time we take over an ecosystem,


245
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,720
clear a forest,

246
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,930
drain a swamp,

247
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,170
create monocultures,

248
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,000
it’s like we pull out a stick.


249
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,709
At first, not much happens.

250
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:07,149
So we keep going.

251
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:11,930
But then one marble drops:
a species goes extinct in some place.

252
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,930
Then another.

253
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,260
And another.

254
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,770
Until you take just one more stick,


255
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,830
and suddenly, nearly all the marbles
come crashing down.

256
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,640
Ecosystems behave
in a somewhat similar fashion.

257
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,710
They are remarkably resilient,
until they suddenly collapse.

258
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:31,534
Here is an example from a place where
we’ve pushed overfishing just a bit too far.

259
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:34,730
Suddenly this ecosystem collapsed.


260
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,889
And the jellyfish population exploded
and completely took over

261
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:41,876
and crowded out the remaining fish
and everything else.

262
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:48,080
We humans tend to think
that we are separate from nature.

263
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,900
But when oceans are empty
and forests are gone,

264
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,810
when there are no insects
to pollinate all our crops,

265
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,706
we human beings
come crashing down with the rest.

266
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:09,190
We could stop the first episode here and
just deal with this one fact of mass extinction.






267
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,089
And let it sink in.

268
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:13,960
But unfortunately
there is a lot more happening.

269
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:19,209
Life collapsing is just one of the three crises
we’ll be talking about today.





270
00:14:20,414 --> 00:14:22,514
The next crisis is pollution.


271
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:25,710
Since the industrial revolution,

272
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,010
people all over the world
have been exposed to pollution

273
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,874
often without even knowing about it.

274
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:33,659
But now it's catching up with us.

275
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:37,435
Frank knows about his first hand.

276
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,829
He lives in Memphis, Tennessee.

277
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:42,630
In a community that's been devastated
by pollution.

278
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,519
I was a typical child from South Memphis,
you know,

279
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,000
growing up in the late seventies, early eighties.

280
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:52,740
I was like the first person to have a fade.



281
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,516
So I brought the fade in 1977/78
or whatever this was.

282
00:14:57,866 --> 00:14:59,668
It was really a great time.

283
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,759
But in the midst of that, you started,

284
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:06,320
we started noticing some
different things happening with mom.

285
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,026
We will get pieces of her saying
and doing crazy things.

286
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:14,026
And I remember being freaked out


287
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,279
because I had heard the stories of
her mother having cancer.

288
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:20,704
And a few years later...

289
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,356
My big sister,
brain tumor, cancerous brain tumor,

290
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,882
same part of the brain as my mom's.


291
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,968
And then a few days later,
my mom's only remaining sister.

292
00:15:30,968 --> 00:15:34,022
She's diagnosed with brain cancer too.

293
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:38,861
So getting back in the neighborhood
and talking to people.

294
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:42,772
All of us are having the same stories.

295
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:49,833
Castalia, which is right across from us,
that whole block was taken out from cancer.





296
00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:53,340
Now right here is Hamilton High School.

297
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,790
And they said one time this school
was covered in arsenic.

298
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:00,996
You can see the towers of the refinery.

299
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,121
They put the refinery on the river
to dump into the river.

300
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:11,065
And we turn to the right,
there's the Defense Depot.

301
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:14,551
This is where they stored
the worst of the worst.

302
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:19,045
All of this is having an effect
in black communities.

303
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:23,656
Children with the behavior disorders,
uh, neurological disorders, all of this stuff.

304
00:16:23,656 --> 00:16:27,310
And everyone is sitting here
shrugging it off.

305
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,609
What happened to Frank, his family
and his community is devastating.

306
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,525
It’s beyond words.

307
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:39,381
Pollution is everywhere,
and no one is safe from it.

308
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:42,220
But so often,

309
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,699
the worst kind of pollution
is concentrated

310
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,920
where working class people
and minorities live.

311
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:53,858
Every year, in the US,
350,000 people’s lives are cut short

312
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,130
just from air pollution.

313
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,969
And in Europe it’s 417,000.

314
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:01,649
417,000 deaths!

315
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:06,262
It's grayish.

316
00:17:06,262 --> 00:17:11,848
Even when it's sunny,
it's overcast and you can see that it's pollution.

317
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:16,470
I mean, what we see there is what we breathe
in.

318
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,084
It goes inside us, into our lungs.

319
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,710
It's scary, actually.

320
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,701
Pollution is a health risk multiplier.


321
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,313
It increases the risk
of so many different things.

322
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,855
I'm already seeing way more patients
with respiratory problems,

323
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:41,523
like asthma and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, lung diseases.

324
00:17:42,884 --> 00:17:46,751
There is another form of pollution
that’s found everywhere, but even less visible.

325
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,650
Something we didn't know, 50 years ago
when we started producing plastic,

326
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,159
is that the plastic we throw out


327
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:56,929
or the plastics in the clothes
we might be wearing right now

328
00:17:56,929 --> 00:17:59,570
break down into microplastics.

329
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,040
Tiny, invisible bits
that are carried everywhere.

330
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,460
Literally everywhere.

331
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:09,695
Researchers have gone to
the most remote place on earth, the Arctic.

332
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,167
And when they melted a gallon of ice,
they found it contains...

333
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:13,957
Are you ready?

334
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:17,060
53,000 particles of plastic.

335
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,365
Carried for thousands of miles by the wind.


336
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:27,165
Microplastic is everywhere,
in the ocean, in the rain, in the rivers.

337
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:29,105
It's in your tap water.

338
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:30,235
It's in the bottled water.

339
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:33,490
It's been found in beer and salt.

340
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,230
It's in the air we're breathing right now.

341
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,515
The air you’re breathing too.

342
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,400
According to researchers
at the University of New Castle in Australia,

343
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:50,000
in one week, we eat, drink and breathe
the equivalent of one credit card in plastic.

344
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,905
That's 4 a month.

345
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,744
It's even found in the placenta
of pregnant mothers.

346
00:18:55,744 --> 00:18:57,175
And in our bloodstream.

347
00:18:57,175 --> 00:19:01,585
Most likely there are microplastics
in your bloodstream.

348
00:19:01,585 --> 00:19:03,915
What this is doing to our health
we don't yet know.

349
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,960
What we do know is
that industry experts predict

350
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,130
that plastic production won't decrease,


351
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:14,540
but most likely increase
by a factor of four in the next 30 years.

352
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,890
How much plastic
will end up in our bodies?

353
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,859
And plastic is just one form of pollution.


354
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,959
Meanwhile we've released chemicals,
pesticides, and heavy metals everywhere.

355
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:26,760
You've probably also read

356
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,870
that our rivers, lakes, and drinking water
are full of medications

357
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,350
like antidepressants and hormones.

358
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,440
We know that this is doing weird things.


359
00:19:36,295 --> 00:19:39,724
Scientists have found that even in
what may look like pristine lakes and rivers

360
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,155
and national wildlife refuges,


361
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:46,594
the chemicals and medication in the water
disrupt the hormonal systems of wildlife

362
00:19:46,594 --> 00:19:49,645
and turn male fish into half female beings.


363
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,255
They have eggs in their testicles.

364
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:55,626
It's in the water we humans drink also.


365
00:19:55,626 --> 00:20:00,715
Infant boys are developing more
genital abnormalities and smaller penises.

366
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,539
More girls are experiencing early puberty.


367
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:07,620
Adult women appear to be suffering
declining egg quality

368
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,940
and significantly more miscarriages.


369
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:14,775
In men there's a boom in two-headed sperm.


370
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:18,455
An international team, including researchers

371
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:21,429
from the school of medicine
of Mount Sinai in New York,

372
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:22,925
found that in just 40 years,


373
00:20:22,925 --> 00:20:27,870
the human sperm count in Western countries
went down by almost 60%.

374
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,960
Following the current trend,

375
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,129
the team of researchers suggested
sperm count could reach zero in 20 years.

376
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:38,779
I don't know how this lands with you.


377
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,330
But 20 years, that's exactly about the time


378
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,754
that our children could want
to become parents.

379
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:50,155
And so for me, this doesn't just feel like,
you know, some science article.

380
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,590
When I look at our children

381
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,640
and I don't know
what's happening in their body,

382
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,910
it feels really personal and,
and disturbing.

383
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:04,119
So we talked about life collapsing,
about pollution.





384
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:07,789
And of course, we all know this,
it’s getting warmer.

385
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:12,447
But before we dive in, let’s start with
a little science refresher on

386
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:17,400
where the atmosphere is
and why it's getting warmer.

387
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:24,275
Our planet is surrounded by the atmosphere,
a very thin layer of air.

388
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:27,110
Incredibly thin,
but absolutely vital.

389
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:30,658
It’s a blanket that protects us
from freezing.

390
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:33,817
Without it, heat would simply go back
into outer space.

391
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:36,510
Gasses in the atmosphere
let the sun rays through,

392
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,150
but trap some of that solar energy.


393
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,270
And that keeps us warm.

394
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:49,830
The trouble is:
when we burn coal, oil, gas or forests

395
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:55,770
we release huge quantities of carbon dioxide,
methane, and similar gases into the atmosphere

396
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,600
which makes the blanket
get thicker and thicker.

397
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,462
It's the reason you don't leave
a dog or a kid

398
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:04,440
in a car alone on a sunny day
with the windows up.

399
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,230
If the sun is shining hard, of course
you leave the windows a bit open!

400
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:13,460
Otherwise the closed windows trap the heat
and your dog or child might die.

401
00:22:14,315 --> 00:22:16,355
That’ s what’s happening
to the earth right now…

402
00:22:16,355 --> 00:22:20,000
We are closing the windows,
and it’s getting hotter and hotter.

403
00:22:20,765 --> 00:22:22,485
With all the gas we’ve added,


404
00:22:22,485 --> 00:22:26,314
the world has become
1.1° Celsius warmer already.

405
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:28,669
That’s 2° Fahrenheit.

406
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:30,850
It doesn’t sound like much,


407
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,850
but it turns out that
the world’s thermostat is

408
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,010
really, really sensitive.

409
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,130
It’s kind of like our body.

410
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:42,280
When our body temperature increases
by 1° Celsius or 2° Fahrenheit,

411
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,830
you know, we start to have fever.

412
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,590
And maybe you remember
the heat dome of 2021

413
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,059
when it was so hot

414
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:51,370
that, all the way north in Canada,

415
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:56,100
a town self-combusted
and burnt down in a day?

416
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,680
Extreme weather events
have always happened.

417
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,900
But now, normal is no longer normal.


418
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:08,359
Not when a city like Houston, Texas,
has experienced a “five-hundred year flood”...

419
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:11,130
... three years in a row!

420
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:15,056
And do you remember these images?

421
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:20,000
This was San Francisco,
during the day!

422
00:23:20,325 --> 00:23:24,685
This is smoke from the massive fires.

423
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:30,780
Ashley, the family doctor in California,
was right there.

424
00:23:32,175 --> 00:23:39,299
So I was on maternity leave and
I was nursing her in the breakfast nook.

425
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,445
And the Paradise Fire started.

426
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,919
It was like one of the
historically worst fires in California.

427
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,785
The smoke was terrible.

428
00:23:51,785 --> 00:23:57,154
And I couldn't take her outside
for 13 days.

429
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,789
I was bringing the air purifier
right beside her

430
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:02,584
and trying to shut the doors of the room.

431
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:04,735
Trying to keep her safe.

432
00:24:06,984 --> 00:24:13,800
I felt like I was seeing her future
and all of our children's future.

433
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,830
It brought the climate crisis

434
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,505
from that intellectual,
cerebral somewhere else, someone else.

435
00:24:21,505 --> 00:24:22,940
Not my life.

436
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,404
It brought it all home.

437
00:24:25,404 --> 00:24:31,995
And you know, I was like watching it and
just tears falling onto her as I realize,

438
00:24:31,995 --> 00:24:34,010
like I've just been asleep.


439
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,549
[Sirens]

440
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:41,560
Global warming, doesn't only mean
things get warmer.

441
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,175
It means weather patterns
get out of whack.

442
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:45,755
We get floods and droughts


443
00:24:45,755 --> 00:24:48,865
that didn't used to exist
for a thousand years.

444
00:24:48,865 --> 00:24:51,445
Droughts all the way up to
Sweden and Canada.

445
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:57,205
Floods like we've never seen in Germany,
Belgium, the UK and so many other places.






446
00:24:57,475 --> 00:24:59,814
Weather patterns are changing everywhere.


447
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:04,370
And more and more of us are
experiencing this firsthand.

448
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,809
Polls show that people everywhere,


449
00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:12,440
farmers, city folk, conservatives,
progressives, and moderates

450
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,004
are now concerned or alarmed with
how the climate is changing.

451
00:25:18,174 --> 00:25:20,110
And as we said, in these films,

452
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,620
we are focusing on Europe
and North America.

453
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,920
But if we want to see
what the future holds for us here,

454
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,529
we only need to look to
some parts of the world

455
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:32,370
where things are already much worse.

456
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:37,084
Take Malawi, in east Africa.

457
00:25:37,084 --> 00:25:39,785
Because of droughts, floods
and certain farming practices,

458
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,405
farmers’ corn yield per acre
fell from 7 bags to below 3.

459
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,105
The country can no longer
reliably feed itself.

460
00:25:49,095 --> 00:25:51,405
Put yourselves in the shoes of people there.


461
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,710
Malawi contributed almost nothing,
less than 0.1%, a rounding error

462
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,700
to the warming blanket,
but they are hit really hard.

463
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:04,965
Or take Syria and its brutal civil war.

464
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:10,585
It started in 2011, after the country suffered
the worst 5-year drought in its history.

465
00:26:11,242 --> 00:26:13,572
One and a half million farmers
had to give up their land

466
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,256
and move to overcrowded cities
and find a way to scrape by.

467
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,565
These droughts were devastating.

468
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:23,900
And many analysts believe
they were a critical factor

469
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:29,759
in sparking the mass protests
that Syria’s dictator then ruthlessly suppressed,

470
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:33,179
leading to the terrible civil war.


471
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:37,644
6 million people had to flee their homes
to neighboring countries.

472
00:26:38,094 --> 00:26:40,854
And one million found refuge in Europe.


473
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:45,360
What the people in Malawi and Syria
have been through

474
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,494
might just be
what we'll face in the future too.

475
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:56,796
OK, let’s, um, let's pause for a second
and, and do a quick time out.





476
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,410
I don’t know how this all lands with you.


477
00:26:59,725 --> 00:27:04,520
You know, this can be pretty hard
or even overwhelming.





478
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,830
And, and maybe for some of you it's,
it's not like...

479
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:12,580
I've, I've noticed that, you know,
sometimes to protect myself from bad news,

480
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,220
there are some protection mechanism
that seem to pop up.

481
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:20,390
You know, kind of unconsciously,
it's like my brain is trying to protect me.

482
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,309
And over time we've noticed

483
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,550
that it comes
in a number of different shapes.

484
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,280
And we wanted to share that with you.

485
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,940
A first mechanism that I noticed a lot is,


486
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,659
is that we might tune out.


487
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:37,990
Maybe you've looked at your phone,
earlier during this film.

488
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,876
I know that I do that a lot,
just to zone out for a second.





489
00:27:43,315 --> 00:27:45,425
Number two is denial.

490
00:27:45,425 --> 00:27:47,740
Maybe during this film
you've been thinking:

491
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:52,185
It can't be this bad.Or:
what do these people know?

492
00:27:52,185 --> 00:27:54,790
Number three is:
I already know this.

493
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,750
There's nothing new for me to hear.

494
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,789
No need for me
to engage with this again.

495
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:01,315
Or four: Wishful thinking.


496
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:02,830
Maybe you've been thinking:

497
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,189
Well, someone will come up with some
technology that will make things okay.

498
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:10,260
Or five: This won’t affect me.

499
00:28:11,475 --> 00:28:13,990
I'll be okay, this is a problem
for other people.

500
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:16,134
I'm in a safe place.





501
00:28:16,134 --> 00:28:18,330
Or I'm resourceful enough.

502
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,789
Or six, uh: Jumping to solutions.


503
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:24,480
If only people did this or that.

504
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,920
Or I'm already doing this and
I'm already doing that.

505
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,064
So I'm doing my part and
I can stop thinking about it.

506
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:33,665
Look at the list

507
00:28:33,665 --> 00:28:36,594
and see if one or several
have happened to you

508
00:28:36,594 --> 00:28:39,094
during the film so far.

509
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:41,415
If you're like me, like...
it will have happened, right?

510
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,740
It's okay.

511
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,560
And, it's actually, it's normal.

512
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,380
It's normal to be heartbroken
or fearful or, or angry.





513
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,370
Something like heartbreaks, you know,
serves a really important purpose.

514
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,309
It reveals to us what we care about,
you know, what is precious to us.

515
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:04,000
So precious that it hurts and that,
that we feel moved to do something about it.

516
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,570
And so here's my invitation to you.

517
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,690
Tf you catch this happening again,
it's okay.

518
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:14,529
Just try to go back and,
and focus on the film again.

519
00:29:15,294 --> 00:29:18,720
OK, so, let’s go back!

520
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,292
The planet is getting hotter and
the weather increasingly out of whack.

521
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:25,882
And when we started reading up on this,


522
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:30,840
we read about what scientists predict
will happen at some point in the future.

523
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,000
Say in 2050.

524
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:38,990
And to be honest, at first, 2050,
it sounded quite far away.

525
00:29:39,395 --> 00:29:43,519
Until one day, we simply calculated
how old we’ll be in 2050,

526
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,450
and how old our children will be.

527
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,885
And to us that was like a real shock.

528
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:51,765
Because we realized like, hey, in 2050,
you know, we'll be in our mid seventies.

529
00:29:51,765 --> 00:29:55,555
So hopefully we'll still be around
and healthy and happy and

530
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,120
and happily retired.

531
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,299
And we realized that our kids
will be in their thirties.

532
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:04,250
They'll be younger than we are today.

533
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,210
And, you know, we don't feel that old.

534
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:11,450
Right, and suddenly everything that
we are reading about the world in 2050,

535
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,520
no longer felt abstract.

536
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,095
You know, it, really hit home.

537
00:30:15,095 --> 00:30:19,848
So now we often ask our friends
to do the same calculation.

538
00:30:20,428 --> 00:30:26,251
In 2050, I would be 69.

539
00:30:27,331 --> 00:30:29,167
I will be 56.

540
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:30,705
46

541
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:32,668
I will be 57 years old in 2050.

542
00:30:32,668 --> 00:30:35,610
In thirty years, I'll be almost 90.

543
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,434
If I'm still 90 by then.

544
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:41,340
So how about you?

545
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,029
How old will you be in 2050?

546
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:49,779
Just take your age
and add roughly 25 or 30 years.

547
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:53,770
Now think of a child in your life
you care about.

548
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,450
Your own child or a niece or a nephew,


549
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,580
or, you know, a child
that's important to you.

550
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,360
[Frank] I think about my nephews.

551
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,360
[Ashley] My daughter.

552
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,360
[Holly and John] My children.

553
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,460
[Ophélie] I think of Lency, my niece.

554
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,976
[Yancy] My great grandchildren.

555
00:31:06,938 --> 00:31:09,318
Who are you thinking of?

556
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,179
If you are all in the same room,


557
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:14,360
we invite you to say their name aloud
to the other people in your group.

558
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,510
Yeah, like, seriously,
say their name out loud.

559
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:22,679
Even if it feels weird at first,
or if you're all speaking at the same time,

560
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,750
or if no one dares to start.

561
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,470
There is something powerful
in saying their name out loud.

562
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,470
[Music]

563
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:37,256
Now add 25 or 30 years to their age too
and say that number out aloud as well.





564
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:44,390
In 2050, Calla will be 32.

565
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,740
I might be a parent
of children in their twenties.

566
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,114
So Noah is 43 and Zia is 40, right?

567
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:56,876
When I'm 90 years old,
my children will be 42 and 45.

568
00:31:57,837 --> 00:31:59,370
I think of Lency, my niece.

569
00:32:00,288 --> 00:32:01,788
She will be 34 years old.

570
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,799
At that age, what's the kind of life
you would want them to have?

571
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,740
You know, in a normal world, right?

572
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:13,970
If, if there wasn't any mass extinction
or pollution or warming.

573
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,559
[Yancy] I want my grandson’s life
to be relaxed.

574
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,140
Stress free.

575
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:27,608
[John] I see my children
sweet and healthy and happy.

576
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:34,067
[Ashley] She’ll probably have a career,
maybe, of some kind.

577
00:32:34,067 --> 00:32:36,559
She will be kind of establishing herself
I would think.

578
00:32:38,263 --> 00:32:40,784
I might have encouraged
my children

579
00:32:41,047 --> 00:32:44,350
to study innovation

580
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,744
or of course, whatever they like.

581
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,299
I wish that for everyone,
not only for my future children.

582
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:57,299
I hope children
will grow up in a normal world.

583
00:32:57,823 --> 00:33:00,443
I would like to be in good health,

584
00:33:00,837 --> 00:33:04,000
to be happy,
at the end of my professional career.

585
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,927
[Peter] That my family has grown,
that my children,

586
00:33:07,927 --> 00:33:11,697
that they have children of their own

587
00:33:12,054 --> 00:33:16,370
and to be there with a large family
and I would be a part of that family.

588
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:19,011
If that came true, I would say,


589
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:21,649
that this life has been worth it.

590
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:27,730
[Yancy] Hummingbird's flying by,
sitting out on the porch with my grandson,

591
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,730
just sharing stories

592
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:32,400
and just looking forward to getting up
every morning.

593
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:36,700
In 2050, I would like to be
a trauma surgeon.

594
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,320
I would have liked to have met Taylor Swift
who is my favorite singer.

595
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,600
I would be her backing singer any day.


596
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,940
You know, at nighttime, we can sit up
and, you know, just dream on the stars.

597
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,000
Let our imaginations go and create,
you know,

598
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,560
and do all of these wonderful things
that I think that we were meant to do.

599
00:34:00,357 --> 00:34:04,570
These are the kinds of things
we might all wish for ourselves.

600
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,169
But unless we massively turn the ship around,


601
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:10,484
2050 is not going to look like this at all.

602
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:15,450
All the fires and wars and refugees
we talked about earlier

603
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,405
are just the beginning.

604
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:20,375
Because we've been adding so much
warming gas to the blanket

605
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:22,085
in the last few years,

606
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:25,435
the world is now getting hotter,
really fast.

607
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:29,770
A group of scientists in Switzerland
found a clever way for us

608
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:32,510
to get a sense of how quickly
things will change.

609
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,069
They published a study
where they project,

610
00:34:35,069 --> 00:34:40,000
for all large cities around the world,
what the weather will be like in thirty years.

611
00:34:40,594 --> 00:34:45,295
For example, what kind of climate will
Montreal and Toronto have, in 2050?

612
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:49,350
It’ll be pretty much like
Washington D.C is today.

613
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,179
That’s the closest match
the group of scientists found.

614
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:54,550
No more snow,
but mosquitos.

615
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,550
Boston?

616
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:59,140
It will be like
Charlotte, North Carolina, today.

617
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,829
Chicago will be like Kansas City.

618
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,490
And Kansas City will be like Dallas.

619
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:08,580
Portland, Oregon will move South
all the way to San Antonio.

620
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,440
For San Diego the closest match is
Tripoli in Libya.

621
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,004
Austin, Texas: Peshawar, Pakistan.


622
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,215
Los Angeles: Hargeisa in Somalia.


623
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:25,395
In Europe, Helsinki and Tallinn will move
1600 kilometers south to Bratislava.

624
00:35:25,395 --> 00:35:27,385
Paris will move to Istanbul.


625
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,615
Rome? To Izmir, in Turkey!


626
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,079
And Madrid? The closest match is Tehran in Iran.






627
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:38,310
It’s as if the whole of Europe and the US
moves hundreds of miles.

628
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,236
And some bits drift off,
in less than 30 years!

629
00:35:43,668 --> 00:35:45,148
Think about where you live.

630
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,952
And what makes it feel
like “home” for you.

631
00:35:47,987 --> 00:35:51,200
You know, whatever feels like home
will change.

632
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:55,520
Maybe you are into hiking,
or hunting, or fishing, or skiing.

633
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:59,200
Well, the kind of trees, and fish
and animals you are used to

634
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,990
are likely to change dramatically


635
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,940
when your home moves
hundreds of miles down the map.

636
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:08,140
The kind of farming and economy
might not be the same.

637
00:36:08,725 --> 00:36:12,284
Cities will become much hotter,
sometimes too hot to enjoy city life.

638
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:16,839
Whatever you call home
is going to change...a lot.





639
00:36:17,424 --> 00:36:21,240
So, life collapsing, pollution, warming…


640
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,584
We are all going to be affected
in some way.

641
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:28,410
We can't predict exactly
when and how things will hit us.

642
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,680
You know, scientists have
really powerful models,

643
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,580
but they don't have a crystal ball.

644
00:36:33,165 --> 00:36:37,543
But we do have a pretty good sense
of what is most likely to hit us.

645
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:40,863
It's migration and
food shortages.

646
00:36:41,605 --> 00:36:45,042
Let's start with the first one,
with migration.

647
00:36:45,475 --> 00:36:49,335
There are lots of places where we live
that might not have a future.

648
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,835
If you live there,
you will have to move.

649
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,280
Say you live in an area that’s affected,
more and more often,

650
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,000
by repeat fires, droughts,
floods or hurricanes.

651
00:37:00,945 --> 00:37:03,280
There comes a point
where insurance companies calculate

652
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,980
that the risk has become too high

653
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,215
and they pull out
and stop offering coverage.

654
00:37:08,215 --> 00:37:10,285
Banks stop making mortgage loans


655
00:37:10,285 --> 00:37:13,874
Which means no more house buyers,
and house prices collapse.

656
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:18,595
A few people see it coming,
and are lucky to sell just in time.

657
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:21,815
Most others will see the equity
they built up suddenly wiped out.

658
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,900
The community shrinks,
there are less taxes to support it,

659
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,520
and the school system
and civic services falter,

660
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,630
pushing more people to leave.


661
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,480
Everyone will be affected.

662
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,359
But whoever can’t afford to leave,


663
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:37,170
usually the elderly
and working class people,

664
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,730
will stay behind and suffer most.


665
00:37:40,855 --> 00:37:44,990
And perhaps this sounds extreme,
but it's already starting to happen.

666
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,415
For example, after hurricane Andrew

667
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:51,040
insurance companies pulled out
of many places in Florida.

668
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,380
Those communities would have collapsed!


669
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,200
The Florida Legislature created
a state-run insurance scheme

670
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,740
forced to offer coverage for places
that no private insurer will touch anymore.






671
00:38:02,145 --> 00:38:04,530
But the climate risk hasn’t disappeared.

672
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:10,167
In no time, it’s Florida’s taxpayers
who took on a massive insurance risk:

673
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:11,547
$511 billion.

674
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:14,866
More than seven times
the state’s total budget.

675
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:17,490
That risk can’t be sustainable.

676
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,235
It’s not just Florida


677
00:38:19,235 --> 00:38:21,685
where the writing is on the wall
for some communities.

678
00:38:21,685 --> 00:38:24,585
There are places throughout the US
where people start to realize

679
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:27,059
that their town might not make it.


680
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:29,135
In North and South Carolina,

681
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,405
in Louisiana,

682
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,665
in New Mexico,

683
00:38:33,665 --> 00:38:35,170
California,

684
00:38:35,395 --> 00:38:36,910
Alaska.

685
00:38:38,575 --> 00:38:39,955
Across the Atlantic, in the UK,


686
00:38:39,955 --> 00:38:43,345
the town of Fairbourne
is already a step further.

687
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,190
It’s not just a hypothetical situation.


688
00:38:47,045 --> 00:38:50,000
It’s officially being decommissioned.

689
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,199
It’s like pronouncing a death sentence
on a community.

690
00:38:54,009 --> 00:38:55,510
Sea levels are rising,

691
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,960
and building a seawall
to protect Fairbourne from floods

692
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,425
is too costly.

693
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,285
Not everything can be saved,

694
00:39:02,285 --> 00:39:05,251
and the government is abandoning
Fairborne to the elements.

695
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:11,525
People who live there will be forced
to leave by 2054 at the latest.

696
00:39:12,065 --> 00:39:16,140
Banks no longer give mortgages
and house prices have collapsed.

697
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,829
There are currently no plans
to compensate homeowners

698
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:22,160
whose asset value was wiped out.

699
00:39:24,387 --> 00:39:25,478
Local and national governments

700
00:39:25,478 --> 00:39:28,960
will have to make more and more
of these heartbreaking calls,

701
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:34,979
which places get saved through sea walls,
flood protection and water pipes,

702
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,501
and which won't.

703
00:39:37,535 --> 00:39:41,575
And when decision makers rule
that a place is not worth saving,

704
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:45,884
will people - like you and I -
will we go quietly?

705
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:49,050
Or will we fight with everything we have?


706
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:53,069
It’s not just sea level rise
like in Fairbourne.

707
00:39:53,069 --> 00:39:57,315
People will have to move away from places
that become too hot to live comfortably.

708
00:39:57,855 --> 00:40:02,355
Remember the heatwave of 2003 in Europe
that caused 70,000 deaths?





709
00:40:02,355 --> 00:40:05,945
It was the hottest year on record
in 500 years.

710
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,930
By 2040, that will be
an average summer.

711
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:13,330
In 2050, scientists believe
almost every summer will be hotter,

712
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,300
and some much hotter.

713
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:20,040
Banks and financial investors
obviously watch this closely.

714
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,605
They buy expensive reports to determine
where it's becoming too risky to invest.

715
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,990
We were able to put our hands
on some of the maps and those reports,

716
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:32,110
prepared by a firm called Moody's.


717
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,510
When it comes to hurricanes,
these are the places deemed at high risk.

718
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,490
This is where you might
find yourself stranded,

719
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:42,974
if insurance companies, banks
and investors pull out.

720
00:40:44,144 --> 00:40:46,665
Here are the communities
Moody’s warns investors about,

721
00:40:46,665 --> 00:40:49,510
because they’ll experience
severe water stress.

722
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,515
When water gets scarce,
people leave.

723
00:40:53,235 --> 00:40:55,480
These are the places
where communities might not have a future

724
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,374
because of recurring wildfires.

725
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:00,000
Here are the communities

726
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,790
where the heat stress in the summer
will be so intense

727
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:05,844
that working outside becomes impossible
during the day,

728
00:41:05,844 --> 00:41:08,100
which brings down the local economy.


729
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:10,620
And then there’s extreme rainfalls.


730
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,205
And rising sea levels.

731
00:41:13,655 --> 00:41:17,584
Do you, or do any of your friends
or anyone in your group

732
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:20,269
live in one of those places?

733
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,395
[Music]

734
00:41:22,395 --> 00:41:24,825
Investors worry about their money,

735
00:41:25,051 --> 00:41:29,139
but for each of us
who live in these places,

736
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:31,380
we've got much more at stake.

737
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:36,945
We are busy building up our lives,
in communities,

738
00:41:36,945 --> 00:41:40,985
and all the while a storm is brewing
that might destroy it all

739
00:41:40,985 --> 00:41:43,935
and knock us back to zero.


740
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:49,025
The US military has done
a similar assessment.

741
00:41:49,025 --> 00:41:52,450
This map shows the military bases
inside the US they are worried

742
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:57,030
will suffer from floods, heat stress,
fires or sea levels rising.






743
00:41:57,255 --> 00:41:59,305
It’s all over the place.


744
00:42:00,295 --> 00:42:03,750
We’ve put the maps you’ve just seen
on The Week’s website.

745
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,235
So after this episode,
you can look up what they say.

746
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:14,160
So, in 2050, there is a serious risk
that either you’ll have moved

747
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,780
or live in a place
people are moving away from.

748
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,320
Or as in our case in upstate NY,


749
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,543
that you live in a place
where lots of people will want to move to.

750
00:42:25,049 --> 00:42:27,175
This animation is based on
important work

751
00:42:27,175 --> 00:42:31,450
published in the “Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences”.

752
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:35,640
The red zones on this map show the places
that are unlivable hot zones today.

753
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,465
It’s 1% of the world’s surface.

754
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:42,930
In 2050, these are the areas
projected to become so hot

755
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,630
that life is almost impossible.


756
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,050
And 20 years later it’s even worse.

757
00:42:49,265 --> 00:42:51,310
“Global warming” doesn’t really
capture this.

758
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,275
It’s more like “global scorching”.

759
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:57,331
Estimates for climate refugees
worldwide in 2050,

760
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,750
that’s less than 30 years from now,

761
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:03,225
range from 200 million to 1 billion.


762
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:08,529
Some of Central America and large parts
of Africa will be unlivable hot zones

763
00:43:08,709 --> 00:43:13,711
and millions will do whatever it takes
to make it to the US and Europe to survive.





764
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,830
Climate migration is already happening

765
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:18,817
Not long ago,

766
00:43:18,817 --> 00:43:23,742
9,000 climate refugees from Honduras
fled north following Hurricane Eta.

767
00:43:24,745 --> 00:43:28,981
They were turned back with clubs and
tear gas at the Guatemalan border.

768
00:43:30,825 --> 00:43:35,625
Every year, 1,000 to 5,000 migrants die,
trying to reach Europe.

769
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:40,030
What will happen as this intensifies?


770
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:43,440
Will we let refugees die
on the other side of the border?

771
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:49,625
Will Canada erect a border wall to keep
people from the US from moving north?





772
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:54,590
Will Northern Scandinavia turn back boats
from mainland Europe?

773
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:58,475
That's 2050
when it comes to migration.

774
00:43:58,475 --> 00:44:00,505
It's not that far away.

775
00:44:01,515 --> 00:44:02,875
Just remember how old you'll be

776
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:07,209
or the child that you thought about in 2050,
when they will experience this.

777
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:13,994
Okay. It's time to move to our next topic.


778
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,685
Food.

779
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,490
[Music]

780
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:20,000
There are 7.9 billion people
on earth right now.

781
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,491
And there might be close to
10 billion of us in 2050.

782
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:26,167
How are we going to feed all of us?

783
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,024
There are 6 major breadbaskets
in the world.

784
00:44:29,024 --> 00:44:31,729
Each one of them will face major issues.


785
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:34,450
For example, in the
Midwestern United States,

786
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:39,319
extreme heat waves, droughts and floods
could cause large-scale crop failures.





787
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:43,900
Not to mention that this bread basket
sits squarely on the Ogallala aquifer,

788
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,230
the biggest in the United States,

789
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,900
and it is being pumped dry.

790
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,720
Already, California faces
massive water shortages,

791
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,375
because the snowpack
in the Sierra Nevada Mountains

792
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:59,250
no longer feeds the rivers reliably
and the aquifers there too are running dry.

793
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,610
No water, no food.

794
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,465
Every one of the 6 major bread baskets
faces new risks.

795
00:45:06,465 --> 00:45:10,384
And by 2050, researchers believe
that 1 year out of 3,

796
00:45:10,384 --> 00:45:14,295
two breadbaskets or more
will fail at the same time,

797
00:45:14,655 --> 00:45:17,124
leading to hunger and social unrest.


798
00:45:18,069 --> 00:45:20,664
The risks on the food system
are piling on,

799
00:45:20,664 --> 00:45:24,398
just when we need to find a way
to feed 2 more billion people.

800
00:45:26,505 --> 00:45:30,700
It’s hard also to imagine
how we’ll avoid terrible wars.

801
00:45:31,285 --> 00:45:33,435
Just take this one case:

802
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:36,390
India and Pakistan will be parched.


803
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:41,341
In red again here the zones so hot
it will be almost unlivable.

804
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,280
India and Pakistan, that's 2 billion people
with nowhere to go.





805
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,689
Trapped between the Himalayas
and the Indian Ocean.

806
00:45:50,409 --> 00:45:51,485
You know, in two countries

807
00:45:51,485 --> 00:45:53,665
who are already have
tense military relationships.

808
00:45:53,665 --> 00:45:56,039
They both have nuclear weapons.

809
00:45:56,334 --> 00:45:58,621
And so do seven other countries
in the world.

810
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:03,820
Closer to home,

811
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:08,740
it sometimes feels like our democracies
are already hanging on by a thread.


812
00:46:09,812 --> 00:46:13,671
And I really do worry,
can they last for another 30 years?

813
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:17,995
When there’ll be millions of
internal and external refugees

814
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,205
and tensions rise to a whole new level?


815
00:46:23,634 --> 00:46:27,595
When some towns get saved
with expensive infrastructure

816
00:46:27,595 --> 00:46:29,169
and others not.

817
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:32,694
And when there’ll be food shortages.


818
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:35,895
Will there be riots and violence?


819
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,865
These are all legitimate questions!

820
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,409
And perhaps you think
that we shouldn’t worry.

821
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:45,189
But the fact
that we are even discussing this,

822
00:46:45,189 --> 00:46:49,470
discussing if these dominoes will fall
or if they will stand...

823
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:52,543
That in itself feels crazy to me!

824
00:46:53,615 --> 00:46:56,425
And we know this is
a lot of information to take in.

825
00:46:56,425 --> 00:47:00,345
You know, if you,
if you need to stretch for a second,

826
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,650
or move around,


827
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,750
feel free to do so.

828
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:05,750
Because,

829
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,420
if this wasn’t bad enough there is
one more thing we need to talk about,

830
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,900
that could make everything
a whole lot worse.

831
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,944
The big thing that scientists worry about
are what they call tipping points.

832
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:22,930
If the warming passes
certain thresholds,

833
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:26,840
it sets off chain reactions
that speed up the warming even more.

834
00:47:28,055 --> 00:47:30,465
Each one of those tipping points
is like a booby trap

835
00:47:30,465 --> 00:47:33,539
that can’t be stopped,
once it’s set off.

836
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:37,960
For example, by 2050,
the Amazon rainforest,

837
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,610
because so much of it has been cut back,

838
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:43,005
might reach the point
where the water cycle changes

839
00:47:43,005 --> 00:47:47,780
and the remaining forest dries out,
burns, and turns into a savannah.

840
00:47:48,751 --> 00:47:51,751
We’ll lose the most magnificent ecosystem
in the world

841
00:47:51,751 --> 00:47:56,612
and with it the indigenous communities
with their ancestral traditions and wisdom.

842
00:47:56,975 --> 00:48:01,700
And the smoke of half a continent will add
a whole new layer to the atmosphere.

843
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,330
In Alaska, Russia and Canada,
the permafrost,

844
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:08,410
the ground that is permanently frozen,
starts to thaw

845
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:12,265
and it releases huge amounts of methane
into the atmosphere.

846
00:48:12,793 --> 00:48:16,728
A gas that traps eighty times more heat
than carbon dioxide.

847
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:21,089
If we hit these tipping points,
things spiral out of control

848
00:48:21,089 --> 00:48:24,740
and we land in what scientists call
a “hothouse” scenario

849
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:27,744
where climate systems shift
to something entirely new

850
00:48:27,744 --> 00:48:31,060
and civilization as we know it
is likely to collapse.

851
00:48:31,735 --> 00:48:33,374
These tipping points are
one of the reasons

852
00:48:33,374 --> 00:48:38,755
the United Nations and others say
we MUST keep warming below 2° Celsius,

853
00:48:38,755 --> 00:48:41,800
and preferably below 1.5°.

854
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,510
Here is the crazy thing:

855
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,290
if we don’t significantly change course,


856
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:52,140
we might see a rise in temperature
of 2° Celsius by 2050.

857
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,734
And that’s when some of the booby traps
might go off.

858
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,240
That’s in my lifetime!

859
00:48:59,365 --> 00:49:00,789
And, you know,

860
00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:03,370
people who are totally freaking out
about climate change?

861
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,435
Well, they are doing so
because of this!




862
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:13,470
I wonder how this all
lands with you.

863
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:17,750
Clearly for us it, you know, changed
the whole way we think about our future.

864
00:49:17,975 --> 00:49:21,490
We had to grieve
the normal future

865
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:23,760
that we thought
that we’d have.

866
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,290
And everyone we know
who grapples deeply with this

867
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:30,000
seems to go through this
in their own way.

868
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,471
[Music]

869
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:36,453
[Frank] We're facing
extinction level events around here.

870
00:49:37,108 --> 00:49:39,726
We're looking at environmental collapse.

871
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:43,222
It scares me for my nephews.

872
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,309
You know, my oldest nephew is 24.

873
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:48,818
My youngest one is 19.

874
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,550
And that can probably be
one of the main

875
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,376
why I don't have kids now.

876
00:49:57,032 --> 00:49:59,770
[Holly] Like even when I hear the question,
do I want grandkids?

877
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:02,158
It's like, of course I want grandkids.

878
00:50:02,158 --> 00:50:03,168
And at the same time,

879
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:06,251
it feels like a little electric shock
at my heart.

880
00:50:06,251 --> 00:50:10,362
Because right now I don’t see
things changing fast enough.

881
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,410
Like if it's my kids
and they're having kids

882
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:17,099
and there are these awful things
that have gotten worse,

883
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:20,720
I need to be able to say,
I tried to do my best,

884
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,527
cause it does wake me up
in the middle of the night.

885
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:28,358
I love life.





886
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,115
And I don't want to tell myself
that when I'm 56,

887
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:35,145
my life may be potentially over,

888
00:50:35,145 --> 00:50:38,295
because we didn't take care of
this freaking planet.

889
00:50:38,295 --> 00:50:39,441
And today,

890
00:50:39,441 --> 00:50:40,648
I want to live

891
00:50:40,648 --> 00:50:42,251
and I want to enjoy life.

892
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:44,159
And I want the people around me


893
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:46,209
to be able to do so too.

894
00:50:53,647 --> 00:51:00,000
The truth is, we can no longer
plan 20 years ahead.

895
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,336
It doesn't make sense to work out
strategies when things are so uncertain.

896
00:51:06,336 --> 00:51:10,504
We kind of have to unlearn planning
far into the future,

897
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:15,246
it's a painful part of the grieving process.


898
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:21,727
I’m brown, so I’m from Kashmir as well,
not just the Netherlands.

899
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:25,660
And I know that, like, I can’t visit
where my ancestor’s came from

900
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,200
because that has been destroyed
by flooding.

901
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,190
Um, that’s kinda something
I’ve always grown up with knowing.

902
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,532
But then I'm very scared,

903
00:51:33,532 --> 00:51:35,960
how my children will be able
to live then.

904
00:51:38,107 --> 00:51:40,316
Well, I don't know,
what will happen to them,

905
00:51:40,316 --> 00:51:43,329
when there is not enough food,
when there is not enough water anymore,

906
00:51:43,329 --> 00:51:46,420
when there is no housing that is liveable.


907
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,537
That is the scenario that we face.


908
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:59,260
[Ashely] Will our kids have the chance
to make the choice to be parents

909
00:52:00,334 --> 00:52:08,028
Will it be, like, possible
to want to have a kid in 20, or 30 years?






910
00:52:09,339 --> 00:52:11,200
I don't know.

911
00:52:12,511 --> 00:52:15,935
And it, like, makes me feel so sad

912
00:52:17,246 --> 00:52:23,005
and guilty for my generation.





913
00:52:24,578 --> 00:52:27,220
That we could be robbing

914
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,592
all of the humans to come

915
00:52:30,592 --> 00:52:34,059
from making that choice.

916
00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:38,876
Like if we love our kids,
we need to be revolting.

917
00:52:38,876 --> 00:52:42,214
We need to change everything.

918
00:52:43,384 --> 00:52:46,736
And we're not.

919
00:52:52,854 --> 00:52:56,339
I used to picture my future,
when I’m older,

920
00:52:56,339 --> 00:53:00,589
with some of the things
that my parents love in their life today.

921
00:53:02,164 --> 00:53:03,730
They are retired,

922
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,809
they cook good food,
they love gardening,

923
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:08,430
they love spending time
with their grandkids.

924
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:11,270
And that’s what I would like
for us too of course.

925
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:16,960
But I’ve come to accept
that’s not what’s going to happen.

926
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:22,369
Most likely,
unless we radically turn things around.

927
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:28,319
When I’m old, when we’re old, um,
it won’t be a happy retirement.

928
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,536
But most likely the hardest years
of our lives.

929
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,720
We know that Raphael and Noemie,
our children,

930
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,720
will most likely face real suffering,


931
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,359
probably hunger and violence
in our lifetime,

932
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:45,775
and after we die,
we are no longer around to protect them.

933
00:53:47,259 --> 00:53:49,740
You know, this is my daughter,
Noemie.

934
00:53:52,394 --> 00:53:56,210
The thing that breaks my heart,
over and over again,

935
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,559
is when Raphael or Noemie
come up all excited

936
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,309
and share something
about when they will have children.

937
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:03,309
You know, "Daddy, Daddy,

938
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:06,180
this, this picture book, you know,
can I keep it for my children?"

939
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:12,339
And, and I try to smile and I, I say “Yes!”
and, and inside my heart breaks

940
00:54:12,339 --> 00:54:19,000
because I know that you'll want to have
children around 2040 or 2050.

941
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,620
And, you know,
unless we massively change course,

942
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,010
I don't know
if you'll want to have children by then.

943
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:29,650
But I don't say this and I, I smile and...


944
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:33,250
because I feel like they still have a right
to some innocence.

945
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:36,536
Like, you know, it's,
it's too early to tell them.

946
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,975
This is it for today.

947
00:54:42,055 --> 00:54:46,045
And part of you might feel relieved
that we addressed this topic head on.

948
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:49,869
Or perhaps you’re just glad
it's finally over.

949
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,849
And maybe none of this comes
as a surprise to you.

950
00:54:52,849 --> 00:54:54,890
Or perhaps you feel numb.

951
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:58,579
Or you’re feeling anger,
or shock, or sadness.

952
00:54:58,579 --> 00:54:59,930
Or disbelief.

953
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,809
Or all of the above.

954
00:55:02,809 --> 00:55:04,000
And maybe what’s most present for you


955
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,339
is one of the protection mechanisms
we talked about earlier.

956
00:55:07,339 --> 00:55:09,490
Like “I already knew all this.”


957
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:11,849
Or “It can’t be this bad."

958
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:16,309
Or, “I’m already doing my part,
so I don’t need to think about this”.

959
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:18,719
Whatever you feel,
in our experience, it’s okay.

960
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:19,719
You know, this,

961
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:22,900
this “U” that we talked about earlier
looks a little different for everyone.

962
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,970
And, in a minute, when the film is over,


963
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:29,210
we’ll invite you to have a conversation
about this with your group.

964
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,870
We have prepared
a little conversation starter

965
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,609
you can use to kick things off.


966
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:37,319
And after the conversation,
when you go back to your life,

967
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:39,460
we have this suggestion for you:

968
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:45,270
try to stay with whatever you’re feeling,
even or especially if it’s uncomfortable.

969
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:49,819
And try not to numb yourself
or throw yourself into the next activity.

970
00:55:49,819 --> 00:55:51,640
Stay with it, soak it in.


971
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:57,220
T he sadness, the anger we can feel
is important.

972
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,900
It's normal
and it serves an important purpose.

973
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,270
Because in our experience,
the more we allow ourselves to feel this,

974
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:06,799
the more energy will come up
at some point in us

975
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,359
to do something about this.

976
00:56:08,359 --> 00:56:11,869
And I know it can be tempting
to suppress those feelings.

977
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:17,160
But then we're also cutting ourselves off
from the energy that they might give us.

978
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,609
That being said, um,

979
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:21,080
if you feel really anxious
and you need support,

980
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,359
please ask for help.

981
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:24,160
Talk to a friend!

982
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,980
We have also put
some resources for you online.


983
00:56:27,565 --> 00:56:31,470
There’s a button that says, um,
“I need support”, click on it.

984
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:36,145
Don’t keep this to yourself
if you feel overwhelmed.

985
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:41,410
Remember:
why do we choose to go through this?

986
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:42,790
Because we have a right to know.


987
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:45,220
Right, everyone has a right to know.


988
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,869
And then we have a right to decide
what we wanna do about it,

989
00:56:47,869 --> 00:56:49,720
so that
if we choose to do so,

990
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,280
we can say
I have no regrets.

991
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,400
And, just so you know:

992
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,790
Today was the hardest part.

993
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,970
S tay with us for parts 2 and 3.

994
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:02,105
Frankly, this would be
the worst time to stop!





995
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:06,180
And the next time is all going to be
about the big question:

996
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,180
So now what?

997
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,810
Is there still hope?

998
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:13,609
We'll zoom out and try to understand:
How did we get into this mess?





999
00:57:13,609 --> 00:57:15,535
And is there a way out?

1000
00:57:16,705 --> 00:57:18,535
Because we've got to fix this, you know.

1001
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,830
After all there is no place else for us to
