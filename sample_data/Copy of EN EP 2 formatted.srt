2
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:09,009
Hi everybody.


3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,809
Welcome back, welcome back.


4
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:11,835
Welcome back.


5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
Welcome back.
It’s good to see you again.

6
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,016
Welcome to this second day.


7
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:20,000
It’s worth continuing this
adventure.

8
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,231
If we're gonna get through it, it's
gonna be together.

9
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,649
So let's keep going.


10
00:00:24,293 --> 00:00:25,025
Hello!


11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,293
We are happy that you’re back.


12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,359
And we hope that you had a good conversation
with your group after the film last time.

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,034
And that you were able to share
how it all landed with you.

14
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:39,039
And yes I imagine that you’re each joining this
second episode in your very own way.

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,360
Some of you might still be processing
or feel shock or anger.

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,359
Or maybe you can’t wait to, you know, roll
up your sleeves and do something.

17
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:51,430
It’s like getting tumbled in the ocean,
just getting cycled into fear and despair

18
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,637
and being paralyzed.


19
00:00:53,637 --> 00:01:00,019
Climate anxiety couldn’t be more
well-founded and so the first step is just to say…

20
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,859
you're, you’re not crazy.


21
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:08,027
This is like a very adaptive and normal response
to a totally unprecedented threat.

22
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,869
We just want to say: welcome to whatever
energy you bring to today’s episode.

23
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:15,034
There is no good or bad way to go about this.


24
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,330
And the format for today is the same.


25
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,680
So we’ll start with this one-hour film,
and then we'll set up a conversation

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,004
for your group for something like
30 minutes or, or more if you can.

27
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:35,012
And today we are at the bottom of the “U”
and we'll explore this question "Is there hope?"

28
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,084
[Music]


29
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:41,810
My hope is that we can save as much as possible.


30
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,399
I don't think there's any preventing
some of the effects of climate change.

31
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,026
But let's save what we can.


32
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,810
I really hope that we wake up.


33
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,033
I hope we, I hope we
don't wait till it's too late.

34
00:01:57,321 --> 00:02:00,037
Today, I am well aware of what is going on.


35
00:02:00,484 --> 00:02:03,040
I can see it, it's right in front of me.


36
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,459
I have two options:

37
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,331
The first one is to see everything and sink


38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,618
and the second option,


39
00:02:11,618 --> 00:02:12,919
is to have energy


40
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,526
and to be optimistic.


41
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:18,126
My nature is not to choose the first option.


42
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:23,018
You have to look for hope, and I think it's
less about you willingly looking, but kinda

43
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:28,739
forcefully making yourself look at those
moments of hope, so that you don't get lost in the

44
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,842
sort of depressing nature of it all.


45
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,959
When it comes to hope,
it’s tempting to look for quick fixes.

46
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,035
You know like renewable
energy or electric cars for instance.

47
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:44,630
But if we really want to answer
the big question of “Is there hope?”

48
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,730
we need to dig a little deeper.


49
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,004
We need first to understand how we got here.


50
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:55,530
Because the real puzzle is this, right: experts
have warned us for more than 50 years about

51
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,770
all this stuff that we talked about right-
the relentless destruction of living systems

52
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,016
and the pollution and the warming.


53
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,129
And heck, like 30 years ago, you know, political
leaders came together at the United Nations


54
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:12,350
and signed a treaty to "combat dangerous
human interference with the climate systems".

55
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,363
If only we had started
to act then, but instead of it,

56
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,420
things have just gotten worse and worse.


57
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,704
So we feel that we first need to
understand how come that we're so stuck,

58
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,850
you know, digging our own hole.


59
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,002
And only after that, we'll look
into the question of how can we change course.

60
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,840
So I hope you're ready because
here we go with episode two.

61
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,410
We'll start with the question.


62
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,819
How come we keep digging the hole we are in?


63
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:44,890
So why don’t we do what we know needs to
be done, you know, the things scientists have

64
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,390
told us for ages we need to do?


65
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,580
In our research, we learn something fascinating.


66
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,480
It turns out that what we set our minds to,
what we think is possible or impossible,

67
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,590
doesn't depend primarily on the
solutions we have or don't have.

68
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:07,039
It depends on something deeper on the
stories, the deep stories that shape our thinking.

69
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,379
Every group in history, every civilization
has a number of deep stories that shapes it.

70
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,580
Collective stories that tell people
what to strive for, what a good

71
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,009
life is and, and how the world works.


72
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,630
Not so long ago, people in Europe and colonial
America took for granted that they were part

73
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,960
of a feudal system with a king at the top.


74
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,334
And when the King dies, however smart
or inept his first-born son happens to be,

75
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:37,027
he gets to rule us all.


76
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,419
People thought: this is how the
world works and will always work.

77
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:45,452
Today, obviously, the idea seems quite ludicrous.


78
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:51,041
Because at some point, and really,
quite quickly,in the late 18th century the story changed.

79
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,005
Historians can argue endlessly about
“why” it suddenly changed, but the fact is:

80
00:04:56,005 --> 00:05:00,217
hundreds of thousands of people
stopped believing in the old story of feudalism.

81
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,870
And embraced a new story.


82
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:07,016
They wrote pamphlets, talked in
the streets,and fought for democracy.

83
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:12,279
In just a few decades, the story of
self-rule became the dominant story.

84
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:17,060
Of course, democracy at first
included only land-owning white men.

85
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:22,000
It took a similar shift of stories to finally
end slavery and racial segregation in the

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,835
US, and that work is still very much ongoing.


87
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,039
In the same vein, until just a
century ago, women weren't allowed to vote,

88
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,041
and everyone took that for granted.


89
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:36,520
A deep, collective story held
that women were inferior to men,

90
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,006
and were not meant to have a public voice.


91
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,889
A group of women rallied
to challenge that idea.

92
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:48,015
It not only got women the right to vote, but
opened the doors to universities and the workplace.

93
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,875
And all the other places
they used to be excluded from.


94
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,022
This is how societies
make profound leaps forward.

95
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,849
We often get this wrong.


96
00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:00,639
We focus on our presidents and
prime ministers and business leaders.

97
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,270
They have the power to fix things, right?


98
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,780
Well, they do, but just like all of us, what
they believe is possible is shaped by the

99
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,734
deep stories that dominate our thinking.


100
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:17,002
Update that story, and laws
and institutions often quickly follow.

101
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,006
I want to highlight this fascinating fact.


102
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:24,240
Profound change can happen quite quickly.


103
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:29,014
But up until the moment it happens,
it often feels like nothing is moving,

104
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:32,643
like nothing can beat the old story.


105
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,021
But if you look under
the surface, that’s not true.

106
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,370
Seeds are being planted.


107
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,028
And more and more people are
leaving the old story for a better one.

108
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:48,990
And then, when this reaches a critical mass,
like things suddenly shift much faster than

109
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,035
anyone could have predicted.


110
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,038
Sometimes in just a few years.


111
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,666
And this is what gives me hope, you know,


112
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,001
for the three crises we talked about last time.


113
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:03,882
More and more of us all over the world
are working hard to bring about a better story.

114
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,090
And right now things feel pretty stuck.


115
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,014
But who knows how close
we could be to a tipping point


116
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,750
where suddenly things change really fast.


117
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,310
I don't know, but I like to try and feel
that like, can you imagine if we

118
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,650
were at that stage where
suddenly things start to tip?


119
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:28,000
Before we imagine a better future, let’s
take the time we need to really understand

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,659
the deep story that got us where we are.


121
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:35,664
And it’s a story that tells us that:
“More is always better”.

122
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:42,004
Like we always need to pursue more
because more will make us happy and safe.

123
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,889
Some call it the “Story of More”.


124
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:50,600
And at some point, we realized that this story
has seeped into every system that shapes our

125
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,870
lives – that’s, you know, what deep stories do.


126
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,289
Maybe you've noticed this too, right.


127
00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:02,024
The Story of More shapes how we produce food,
what we consume, how we produce energy,

128
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:04,690
how we run our education systems, …


129
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,060
In all of these places, we strive
for more, and more, and more.

130
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,033
And at first, it makes sense…


131
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:18,319
until we reach a point where instead of
bringing more happiness and more prosperity…


132
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,002
it brings more loneliness and more destruction.


133
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,820
Today we'll look at 3 of these systems - those
that are responsible for most of the destruction

134
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,010
we talked about in episode 1.


135
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:37,017
So, first we’ll look at Food, then
Consumption and Production, and finally Energy.

136
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,022
And for each of them, we'll first
look at the old Story, the Story of More.

137
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,026
So yeah, unfortunately, we'll
dwell a little bit more on the ugly stuff.

138
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,448
But then, for all 3 topics, we'll also
look at a better story that is emerging.

139
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,035
So, let’s start with our food system.


140
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,420
Why food?


141
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,560
What does it have to do with climate
change, or mass extinction or pollution?

142
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,880
Well it turns out a lot, right!


143
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,008
The way we produce food and transport it
and waste so much of it along the way,

144
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:14,221
is a key driver of pollution and
the collapse of the living planet.

145
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,434
And it produces 30% of all
the gas that warms our planet.

146
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,029
Let’s just look at how eggs are produced.


147
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,180
It used to be pretty straightforward.


148
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,620
Every farmer used to have a few chickens in
their backyard that would eat bugs and food

149
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,655
scraps and then lay eggs.


150
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,658
Farmers knew their personalities.


151
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,820
Just like humans, chickens form complex hierarchies.


152
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,040
Some chickens are shy, some are
aggressive and some are curious.

153
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,002
But then, the Story of More took over.


154
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,007
An accountant who owned some chickens
had the idea to put them in vertical cages,

155
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,010
so you can concentrate
more chickens per square foot.


156
00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:00,017
That idea naturally led to cram more and
more chickens in each cage to maximize profit.

157
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:03,770
Farmers were forced to play
along or they would be left behind.

158
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,025
You could simply no longer
compete if you let your chickens run free.

159
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,030
The trouble is: when chickens are confined
like this, in a way that nature never intended,

160
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,810
they go mad and attack each other.


161
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:21,100
An extra step was added to make this work
and keep the chickens from killing each other:

162
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,001
the beaks of chicks are clipped or
burned off in a machine, with no anesthesia.

163
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:34,290
Imagine how you would feel if you had to do
this job for 8 hours a day, burning off the

164
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,550
beaks of thousands of chicks!


165
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,920
Now, chickens can go mad
without killing each other.

166
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,019
Which means you can stuff millions
of hens into gigantic egg factories.

167
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,570
But that brings up another problem.


168
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,026
When millions of animals are crammed
in a way that doesn’t happen in nature,

169
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:55,520
infectious diseases evolve that
kill  off whole flocks, again and again.

170
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,034
So all the chickens need to
be put on antibiotics, all the time.

171
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:04,039
Without constant antibiotics,
the factory system would collapse.

172
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:09,000
But far from being a solution,
this creates two new big problems.

173
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,004
Two ticking time bombs.


174
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,843
For one, millions of animals sitting in their
own waste is the perfect breeding ground

175
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,012
to grow deadly viruses.


176
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:24,226
Experts warn us that if you want to
create a deadly, global pandemic for humans,

177
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,645
just build factory farms.


178
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,857
The second thing they worry about
is the massive overuse of antibiotics -

179
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,470
the same antibiotics we humans use.


180
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,870
It’ll breed bacteria that
become resistant to these antibiotics.


181
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,250
And when that happens…


182
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,037
well, surgery and childbirth will
gradually become a potentially fatal risk again,

183
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,980
as it used to be.


184
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,667
Chemotherapy will no longer be safely practiced.


185
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:53,790
Infectious diseases we have
forgotten will return to be deadly threats.


186
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,007
That’s the Story of More.


187
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,180
Every step has some logic to it, but it
ends up creating a Frankenstein system.

188
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:09,170
Eggs are just one example, but the
story of factory farming is similar for turkeys,

189
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,022
pigs, and cows.


190
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,640
And to feed all these animals with soy
and grain, the pressure is relentless to take

191
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,030
over more precious ecosystems.


192
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,240
We get 18% of our energy
intake from meat and dairy.

193
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,220
But it’s not 18% of the world’s
farmland that we use for meat and dairy.

194
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,680
It’s… 83%.


195
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,630
And that’s why we keep burning more
of the Amazon rainforest, bringing it closer to collapse.

196
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:43,670
One thing we really, really ask you to do is:
don’t blame farmers for this absurd system!

197
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,670
Yeah.


198
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:48,490
Farmers feed us and the farmers
I know work harder than anyone else.

199
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,399
Like they never get a day off, right?


200
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,510
They're often the first one to suffer from
the system that they haven't chosen or even

201
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,250
designed, right.


202
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,639
In this system all of the profits get sucked
up out of the farms and farming communities

203
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,420
into a few giant meat companies.


204
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,910
And every year thousands of small farms,
you know, give up, crushed, you know by debts

205
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,001
and by these giant factory farms.


206
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,004
And it's a terrible deal
for us taxpayers too, right.

207
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:21,000
Most of us don't realize, but we prop up
these gigantic factory farms

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,180
with millions of dollars, pounds and euros
of subsidies creating an uneven playing field

209
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,040
that make it hard for smaller family farms.


210
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,024
The whole factory meat industry has become
so ugly that we’re not even allowed to see it.

211
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:42,720
Did you know that in the US, meat lobbyists
convinced legislators in many states to make

212
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,035
it a “terrorist” offense to
film inside factory farms?

213
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,665
No one is allowed to inform the
public about what’s going on inside!

214
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:59,005
So over and over again, we’re led
to believe that the food we eat is this

215
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,812
when really it’s this.


216
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:05,850
And I hate that we have so little choice.


217
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,750
Think about what you had to eat today,
you know... for breakfast or for lunch.

218
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,750
I don't know, can you remember what it was?


219
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:20,026
It's almost certain that if you had meat,
egg or dairy, it came from a factory farm, right.

220
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:24,520
Even though it's entirely possible, as we'll
see, to raise animals in a different way that

221
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:30,036
heals rather than destroys the planet,
but you're almost never given that option.

222
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,060
And it’s not just meat.


223
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,010
It’s the bread, the fruits
and vegetables we eat too.


224
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,149
When chemical firms discovered they could
transform petroleum into cheap pesticides

225
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,220
At first, it looked really promising.


226
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,430
But now we wake up and see how vibrant ecosystems
have vanished at the hands of massive monocultures

227
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,860
and pesticides.

228
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,440
Fertilizer runoff pollutes rivers
and lakes we can no longer swim in.

229
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,690
Food is massively wasted
before it even gets to the supermarket.

230
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,959
And lots of farm hands are exploited.


231
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,320
And we eat products full of pesticides that
might give us cancer and other diseases.

232
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,120
My childhood farm, where I grew up in
central Illinois, um, we really, really wanted to

233
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,779
be good stewards of the land…
The trouble, you know with that...

234
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:27,010
It turns out that the use of herbicides has
lots of short-term and long-term consequences...

235
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:32,740
My father, you know, he was, you know, a chemical
applicator just on our farm...He was diagnosed

236
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,149
with Parkinson's at 46.


237
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:39,022
46 years old is fairly young
to come down with Parkinson's.

238
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:46,690
In the Story of More, we optimize
one thing at the expense of everything else.

239
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,329
We isolate one breed of chicken or one plant
on thousands of acres, and squeeze every drop

240
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:54,410
of productivity out of it.


241
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,889
But everything around it dies.


242
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:01,730
It’s the same with profits: family farms
and local communities who do the hard work


243
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,389
are suffering or closing down.


244
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:09,600
All the profits go to a handful of
large traders and big agriculture firms.

245
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,288
It's another system gone mad.


246
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:19,020
If we start measuring right now by the
amount of farmers that we are losing every year,

247
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,290
you know, the system is
already started to disintegrate.

248
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,209
Like we can be incredibly clever and we can
come up with these really complicated systems

249
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:29,980
and mass food production.


250
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:35,220
But if it's on the wrong target, because it's
going to eventually come back and bite us

251
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,038
in the butt.


252
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:46,380
This factory farm industrial model isn't going
to work in the long term...there's gonna be

253
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:51,010
a point in which the
systems are going to fail.

254
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,350
Why are we sharing all this?


255
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,459
It’s not that we like this disturbing stuff.


256
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:04,023
But we really need the courage to understand
the Story of More if we want to get to a better one.

257
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:09,270
And I don't know about you, but I know that I
often just wanna shrug this all off and just say

258
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,020
like, hey, yeah, you know this is normal.


259
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:18,059
It's not easy for me to actually stand still
and accept and admit that I live in, and that

260
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:23,150
I participate in, in, in these larger Frankenstein
systems that have become deeply destructive

261
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,530
and absurd.

262
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:31,009
Okay...it’s time to move on to our
second example: Consumption and Production.

263
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,015
In our Western part of the world


264
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,016
the value of someone's life,


265
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,560
and what makes a good life


266
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,646
is often measured by our possessions.


267
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,025
Whether it is a nice
car or a great house or

268
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,930
the fancy vacation you have.


269
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:55,490
It’s only with this whole philosophy of
infinite growth paradigm that we come out

270
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,036
with this foolishness that we have now.


271
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,970
The Story of More tells us
that we are what we own.

272
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,340
That if something doesn’t feel right, or
if we’re unhappy, we just need something

273
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,008
more to make us happy again.


274
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,500
Now we all know that these
things don't make us happier.

275
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,290
But it’s pounded into our brains every
day with billions of dollars of advertising.

276
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,130
How did we get here?


277
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,730
A hundred years ago, a new generation was
growing up in the Western World whose basic

278
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,100
needs were finally being met.


279
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,010
We could have celebrated that we were now
free to focus on what really makes life meaningful.

280
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,000
But we went down a different path.


281
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:46,459
In 1929, a commission established by President
Hoover – the “Committee on Recent Economic Change"

282
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,628
came up with a clear vision.


283
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:54,809
Advertising can “develop national
consumption habits” and create "new wants, which will


284
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:59,919
make way for endlessly newer
wants as fast as they're satisfied”.

285
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,049
In the decades that followed, advertising
techniques have become very sophisticated.

286
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:09,460
The key driver of modern advertising is to
start with making us feel bad about ourselves.

287
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:15,440
That’s why models in advertising are
photoshopped to be impossibly thin and good-looking,

288
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,420
and live in houses that most
of us will never be able to afford.

289
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:22,850
Unconsciously, we are made to feel insufficient.


290
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,041
Only to be suggested that… if we
would only buy this, we’d be better off,

291
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,309
we’d finally be happy and whole.


292
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:32,940
And the trick gets repeated again and again.


293
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,426
Once a person enters professional life,


294
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:39,053
they have freedom, they can
take a vacation whenever they want

295
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,640
Some people also want to
climb the social ladder

296
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,021
with a nice purse, with a beautiful suit,
beautiful things etc.

297
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,650
Then at some point, little by little,


298
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,029
after going to very good restaurants,
and taking beautiful vacations,

299
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,241
I began to realize something vicious


300
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,036
Because I work so much;
I am trying to make up for it with

301
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:10,001
outings, trips, restaurants,
objects, purchases...

302
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,004
But in fact, that doesn't make up for it.


303
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,508
It sort of feels like a big waste.


304
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,968
Why are we all wearing blinders


305
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,055
in this rat race to nowhere.


306
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,015
that doesn't make anyone happy?


307
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:29,020
Consumption is another system gone crazy –


308
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,850
not only are we made unhappy so we buy things


309
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:36,770
we don’t really need, but we
are pushed into debt to do it.

310
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:42,070
We work ever longer hours to make ends meet,
come home so exhausted, we collapse in front

311
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,630
of the TV.


312
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,419
Compared to our parents and grandparent’s
generation, we have far less time to hang

313
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:52,330
out with friends and
become involved in our community.

314
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:57,410
For many of us, the Story of More
has really become a story of loneliness.

315
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:02,290
Our grandparents used to be deeply embedded
in their community - through volunteering,

316
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:08,580
church groups, unions, dancing at the fair,
community sports, or hanging out in public

317
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,480
spaces.


318
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,950
Much of that has disappeared.

319
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:21,580
Who I talk to, my patients and my
community, people are generally not very happy.

320
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:29,850
And I think people feel very lonely and, what
they can buy or flying here for the weekend,

321
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:37,630
the kind of the heavy impact
consumer role, It doesn't lead to happiness.

322
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:43,340
Studies show that today, loneliness
kills more than cigarettes or heart disease.

323
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,330
And I’m sure you can think, you know, of at
least one person that you love that is struggling with

324
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,018
loneliness or depression or addiction.


325
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,340
And they’re not the only ones.


326
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,759
It turns out, 50% of Americans
say no one knows them well

327
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,420
and 35% say they are chronically lonely.


328
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:07,100
In Europe, 75 million people are so isolated,
they never see a friend or a family member,

329
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,037
or they do so once a month at most.


330
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,770
I remember reading an article that
made a deep impression on me years ago.

331
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:23,009
Nurses in a terminal care unit of a hospital
listed the major regrets of people about to die.

332
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,635
And here’s the top 3:


333
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,641
I wish I'd had the courage to live a life
true to myself, not the life others expected of me.

334
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,970
I wish I hadn't worked so hard, and
had spent more time with the people I love.

335
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,830
And I wish I'd had the
courage to express my feelings.

336
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,850
And it stopped me in my tracks.


337
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:45,580
Because at the time, I was working way too
much, you know, I had little time for friends,

338
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,730
I was chasing the next promotion
and a bigger paycheck.

339
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,480
And according to the Story of More
everything was right on track, right.

340
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
Except it wasn't, right?


341
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,150
It turns out it robbed me of 10 years of my life.


342
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:03,007
Like they just flew by and I can
barely remember them because I worked so much.

343
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,370
And it wasn't a conscious choice I made.


344
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,419
It's just that, you know, already growing
up that Story of More was everywhere

345
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:11,960
around me.


346
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,200
And this message is even
more relentless for kids today.

347
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,799
To be happy and worth something,
you need to have the newest toys, wear the coolest

348
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:22,799
brands.


349
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,600
You need more followers, more likes.


350
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,040
There are countless studies that show
that the current generation of teens today is the

351
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,037
most anxious and depressed ever.


352
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:39,940
This mad consumption system requires
an equally destructive production system to sustain it.

353
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,007
We have to dig up ever more metals
and transform ever more petroleum into plastic.

354
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,870
Transform it in faraway factories.


355
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:53,015
Ship it around the world, for the
whole thing to end up in landfills just a bit later.

356
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:59,021
Dig it, make it, trash it, that’s the
essence of today's production system.

357
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:03,640
And when you think about it, it’s astonishing
how many resources go into something that

358
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,240
is meant to be used just once,
thrown away and never used again.

359
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,640
Take a plastic spoon for instance.


360
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,940
It's somehow easier to pump oil out
of the ground, ship it across the world, turn it

361
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:25,240
into a plastic shape, wrap it in more plastic,
ship it across the world again, use tons of

362
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,900
gas to deliver it to millions of shop,
than it is to simply wash a spoon?

363
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,159
We are really hitting a wall.


364
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:37,660
And obviously it’s the same
with our last example - Energy.

365
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,023
When it comes to energy, we all
pretty much know what the old story is.

366
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,330
For a long time, we had to rely on oil, gas
and coal – the primary energy sources on

367
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,656
which our modern lives are built.


368
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:56,240
Fossil fuels have made so much possible -
so in many ways, we can be grateful for what

369
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,899
this has done for us.


370
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:02,001
But here too, we are
reaching the end of a story.

371
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,539
Once it was easy to find oil and gas.


372
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:10,409
But because we need ever more of it,
now we have to dig deeper and deeper to find it,

373
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:13,130
and take more and more risks.


374
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,970
And move towards dirtier and dirtier sources.


375
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:22,646
Too often we get massive spills where we
extract it, and we get spills when we transport it.

376
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:28,100
We deploy our military all around the world
to secure the supply we depend upon, and pay

377
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,770
billions to dictators we’d
otherwise never pander to.

378
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:36,970
And then, of course, there is the issue
that burning fossil fuels is the main driver of

379
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:42,059
climate change, or as
some now call it - global scorching.

380
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:46,380
We must leave the fossil fuels we have in
the ground, or we’ll trigger the booby traps

381
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,006
we talked about on day 1.


382
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:55,360
This can sound like big
geo-political stuff that has nothing to do with me.

383
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,432
But we’re all trapped in that system.


384
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:04,429
And everytime I plug in my phone,
or switch on lights in the house or put gas in the car,

385
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:10,450
I’m forced to participate in a bit
more destruction, pollution and warming.

386
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,863
Even though I don’t want to.


387
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,779
So we've looked at three examples and
it's pretty clear that the story of more however

388
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:20,970
successful it was for a
while is no longer serving us.

389
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,659
We need something better.


390
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:25,876
Well, here is the hopeful part.


391
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:31,610
If we know where to look, we can see
a new story emerging, in all sorts of fields and

392
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,789
all sorts of places.


393
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:34,620
A better story.


394
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:40,309
And it’s only the beginning, but in that
story is a powerful seed that could help us

395
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:42,852
overcome the enormous crisis we’re facing.


396
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,360
So what does a better story look like?


397
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,023
Let’s go back to food.


398
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,985
[Birds singing]


399
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:57,130
Look how much he likes to have his back rubbed.


400
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,690
I think he likes me better.


401
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,490
I think he does too,
he always likes girls better.

402
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,100
Yeah, that’s right, cause girls are better.


403
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,490
My name is Holly Arbuckle and John
and I are the co-founders of Singing Pastures.

404
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,090
And that's our farm.


405
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,258
Where we raise pasture-raised non GMO pigs


406
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,219
and we sell food from our farm and other farms


407
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,910
around the country.


408
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:24,610
The kind of farming that Holly and
John practice is called regenerative farming.

409
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:30,669
It’s both ancient and its
principles as well as being cutting edge.

410
00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:35,654
Our form of farming is, you know,
biomimicry, it’s farming in nature’s image.

411
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:40,034
Nature has a plan
that works really really well.

412
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:46,980
Every grassland on earth co-evolved
under the evolutionary pressure of a large group

413
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,001
of grazing herbivores.


414
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:56,634
So, we’re gonna replicate what the bison
were doing here, what the wilderbeast do in the serengeti,

415
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,636
what the caribou doin the far north.


416
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:05,017
We are gonna keep the animals
relatively tightly bunched and continuously moving.

417
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:11,039
We think of ourselves as grass farmers,
as carbon farmers, we think of ourselves and

418
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,028
our livestock as
instruments that are healing ecosystems.

419
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:22,690
You know, I see fields that used to be bare,
cracked soil and sparsely populated with thorn bushes.

420
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:27,680
And now they're growing, you know,
12 species of forage and they are lush and they look

421
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,041
like Ireland.


422
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,559
See, this is exactly what we want.


423
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:38,008
All the soil particles literally look
like you are looking at chocolate cake.

424
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,011
Look at all the roots going through it.


425
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:49,600
Regenerative farming replaces all the
expensive pesticides and fertilizers with natural principles.

426
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,500
And not having to buy those
means more profits stay on the farm.

427
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:59,600
I got into the world of regenerative
agriculture ...It was a profit question.

428
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,649
You know, we were noticing that our farm
didn't make enough money…Sometimes I wish they

429
00:29:03,649 --> 00:29:05,140
just didn't call it regenerative farming.


430
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,830
I just wished they called it, you know, a
profitable, sustainable farming or something,

431
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:13,002
you know, because I think that we would
attract more of the people we want to attract.

432
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,520
Our costs go down,
our production increases, the animals are happier.

433
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,010
The animals require less pharmaceuticals.


434
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:30,409
We have low cost, simple, effective
solutions that could quickly build soil which is gonna

435
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:34,700
sequester carbon, it’s gonna
mitigate the risk of both flooding and drought, it

436
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,950
makes the food more nutritious,
it helps restore healthy water cycles.

437
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:39,950
And we can do it.


438
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,031
And we can do it right away.


439
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:49,580
In a farm that uses advanced regenerative
practices, like John and Holly’s, life bounces

440
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,929
back - songbirds and wildlife return.


441
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:58,029
And through photosynthesis, crops and
lush grasslands absorb tons of carbon from the

442
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:04,030
atmosphere and store it in the topsoil
they recreate - 2 to 5 tons per hectare or more,

443
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,100
every year.


444
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,370
This is a picture of
typical land in industrial agriculture.

445
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:14,240
And here is what it looks like, 10 years later,
when a farm took part of the land and switched

446
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,460
over to regenerative agriculture.


447
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:22,610
We’ll soon need to feed 10 billion
people and big agriculture firms tell us we need

448
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,031
chemicals to do that.


449
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,034
Well there are many studies that show us that
we don’t.

450
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:33,039
We can grow as much food per acre or
more when we work with natural patterns rather

451
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,690
than against them.


452
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:39,630
My primary motivation is to
improve the lives of farmers and the earth.

453
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:45,636
I want farmers to be able to
grow more food and have better profits.

454
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:48,597
...and healing ecosystems


455
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:53,018
because I feel intimately connected
to the land that I produce food on.

456
00:30:56,105 --> 00:31:01,679
Regenerative farms, like John and Holly’s,
are starting to spread - just in the US, there

457
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,059
are more and more, and
it’s the same in Europe and beyond.

458
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:08,110
Now we need to dream bigger!


459
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:13,419
Say to scale it up to a whole region, like
in France, in the Drôme valley, where one

460
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:16,041
third of farmers are already organic.


461
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:21,980
Or to a whole city like Liège, where my
family is from, that developed a vision to get all

462
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,008
of its food from local and sustainable farmers.


463
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:29,847
And link those farmers to local shops
and bakers and of course - this is Belgium,

464
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,080
you know - to local brewers!


465
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:37,680
It’s early days, but it’s with this kind
of vision that we can eventually shift a whole

466
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,022
food system.


467
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,679
And then to go even further, you know to
speed up this transition to regenerative farming

468
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,200
on a large scale.


469
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,600
We need governments to stop the wasteful
subsidies that keep industrial and factory farming going.

470
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:56,029
If we stop that, and instead,
support regenerative agriculture,

471
00:31:56,029 --> 00:31:59,084
this system could tip and
it could actually tip quite fast!

472
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,330
Farmers will be the heroes
that help us cool down our planet.

473
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:08,010
You’ll swim in rivers and lakes again, everywhere.


474
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:14,016
And no one will have to breathe in
pesticides or cut the beaks of chicks for 8 hours a day.

475
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:18,020
Family farms can make a living again.


476
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:23,442
That's what 2050 could look like, for all
of us, if we radically turn the tide now.

477
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,654
And I don’t know about you,
but that’s the 2050 I want to be a part of.

478
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:31,658
We can actually make the world
cooler again, more beautiful again.

479
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:36,038
Wildlife and ecosystems could flourish
and our food system can become more stable.

480
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:45,005
These are images from the Loess plateau
in China, a region the size of the Netherlands.

481
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,130
Overgrazing had turned the region into a desert.


482
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:53,639
In the 1990s, local authorities
embarked on a major program to revive it.

483
00:32:53,847 --> 00:33:00,490
People created terraces to store rainwater,
they planted trees which also retain water…

484
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,320
Within ten years, life exploded.


485
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,970
7 rivers have come back to life.


486
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:09,490
The economy bounced back too,
providing livelihoods for thousands of people.

487
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:15,620
I can't help myself, like I, I just love to
go back and forth on these images.

488
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,830
You know, back and forth, back and forth…


489
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,249
like it’s...it's just amazing!


490
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,899
Life can bounce back at breakneck speed.


491
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:29,633
Empty oceans find abundant life
again if we allow them to recover.

492
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,011
Even in the city you can regenerate life.


493
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,014
Or in your front yard.


494
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,017
We could even return land to wilderness.


495
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:45,019
As we mentioned earlier, most of the
world’s farmland is tied up to meat and dairy.

496
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:48,310
And Today, 40% of food in the world is wasted.


497
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:52,220
That’s 40% of all farmland going to waste.


498
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,620
So if we reduce food waste and if we get
more proteins from plants and from plant-based

499
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,038
meat and dairy, we could free up so much land.


500
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,080
Not only could we feed everyone, but we
could return huge tracts of less productive land

501
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,580
to nature and let them go wild again!


502
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,599
So that’s the better
story when it comes to Food.

503
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,014
A new story is also emerging for consumption
and production, the other topic we talked about.

504
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:22,490
Well, in many ways, this new story is full
of common sense and wisdom from the past.

505
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:26,648
It tells us something
we all know deep down inside.

506
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:32,080
What really makes us happy
and safe is not the stuff we buy.

507
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,034
It’s our relationship, our friendships,
the community we feel a part of,

508
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:39,036
the meaning we find in what we do.


509
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:45,560
For millions of years, people have lived
in harmony with the planet, you know, we understood

510
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,628
not to take too much and
to give back and to take care of.

511
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:54,599
That doesn't mean you have to give up all
of your possessions or do a Marie Kondo and

512
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,240
become a minimalist and give everything up.


513
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,450
I think it's more about respecting yourself,
​​respecting your bank account and your

514
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:05,089
work, and respecting the earth
and the people who made your things.

515
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:08,340
Um, the systems
who brought your things to you.

516
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:16,031
The more I get involved in working with
my community towards our collective interest.

517
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:24,460
It's much more fulfilling than what I could
buy...There's studies about the pleasure that

518
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,930
comes out of spending time
with people... versus buying something.

519
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,006
Buying something,
it doesn't boost your level of happiness.

520
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:37,010
But being more connected to a community does.


521
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,539
[singing]


522
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,109
This is Barcelona, in Spain.


523
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,020
Much of the city has a grid design.


524
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,040
In some areas, they’ve created “super
blocks” of 9 blocks where cars can drive

525
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,029
on the outside, but inside,
the streets are for people, not cars.

526
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,089
Inside the block, kids can play safely.


527
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:01,470
People exercise, meet friends, dance.


528
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:05,038
Vegetable and flower gardens take over.


529
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,400
You know what people love more than anything?


530
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,900
The humble picnic bench!


531
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:13,004
Put a few picnic benches out,
and people organize birthday parties.

532
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,007
People come out, sit down and talk.


533
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:21,138
At first, some residents opposed the idea
of the superblocks, as happens with any change.

534
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:26,290
But just a year later, it’s such an
overwhelming success, no one wants to go back.

535
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:31,630
Give us a space to meet and hang out and step
off the treadmill of working, consuming, working,

536
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,040
consuming and we take it!


537
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,196
The plan in Barcelona is to create 500 superblocks,


538
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,034
it will profoundly change the city for the better.


539
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,020
I love that story!


540
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:50,180
Not that super blocks are going to be
enough to save us, but the fact that we’re using

541
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:55,130
space to support connection
and community that is huge.

542
00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:01,370
And suddenly, we have a space where we're
not expected to be either consumers or workers.

543
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:05,060
There's a space to just be.


544
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,260
And in the same vein,
there's a story we love from Switzerland.

545
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,390
Two young designer had the simple idea.


546
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:15,990
They created sheets of stickers with
logos of items that you might be willing to lend

547
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,444
to a neighbor.


548
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,445
Think about it, right.


549
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:22,740
Are there things that you own
that you would be okay to lend to someone?

550
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,420
Perhaps a drill or a ladder
or a waffle maker or a camping tent?

551
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:32,609
I don't know if you've pictured a few things,
but now imagine you put the corresponding

552
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:34,750
stickers on your mailbox.


553
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:39,500
And you invite people in your
apartment block or in your street to do the same.

554
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,660
If they want to, with the item that they own.


555
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:46,640
Now, every time you enter your building or
walk along your street, you'll see all the things

556
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,430
you have access to, for free.


557
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:55,023
And it also builds community, the very thing
that has been proven to make us happier in life!

558
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:58,230
You know, that to me is like the better story.


559
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,230
We can relax.


560
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:04,032
We spend less money and yet we have
access to what we need when we need it.

561
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:10,038
In the same spirit, more and more local
communities have tool libraries and toy libraries.

562
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:13,041
Why would libraries be only for books?


563
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:20,060
We have actually a repair cafe where people
who know how to fix things come, and people

564
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:26,012
have broken things come, and
then you fix it or they fix it and you like watch.

565
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,641
Repair cafés are popping up everywhere –


566
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:35,599
in schools, in community centers,
and in church basements - places where passionate fixers

567
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,560
help you repair stuff for free,
because they love doing it.

568
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:46,040
It is way more fun than just buying
something new. You know, you're connected to

569
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:50,460
this, you know, kid who goes to college
and you like, see that he can fix it and,

570
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,039
you know, there's lots
of people who have different skills,

571
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:59,290
Repair cafés, just like second hand shops,
toy and tool libraries help us get away from

572
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:03,430
the old linear system of
“dig it, make it, trash it”.

573
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:08,640
Instead, we move to a circular system
where we start with reducing what we produce and

574
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,790
manufacture to only what is really needed.


575
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:15,830
And then we share it, reuse it
and repair it over and over.

576
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,770
And only when that’s no longer
possible, do we recycle it.

577
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:25,030
And we do all of that without pollution and
without fossil fuels that overheat the planet.

578
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,870
That’s the new story of consumption!


579
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,246
But what about manufacturing and mass production?


580
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:36,060
Is it possible to have
a better story there, too?

581
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,930
I mean at a really large scale?


582
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:46,009
Well, yes, Ray Anderson, a businessman
from Georgia is a great example of this.

583
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:53,290
Ray founded a company called Interface in
1973 and grew it into the largest carpet manufacturer

584
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,920
in the world.


585
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,050
You know those 20-inch
carpet tiles you see in offices everywhere?

586
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,023
That’s Interface.


587
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,567
I was not an environmentalist.


588
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:07,800
I hadn't given I had never given a thought
to what we were taking from the earth or doing

589
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,920
to the earth to make our products.


590
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:18,460
But when I found Hawkins book it was a
spear in the chest and I read it and wept because

591
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:25,730
it just laid out so clearly the problems
of the industrial system, the system of which

592
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:30,637
my company, my creation,
this third child of mine, was an integral part.

593
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,680
At the time, Ray Anderson was 60.


594
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,230
He realized that his business relied
on extracting 1.2 billion pounds of raw materials a year -

595
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:46,653
most of it oil and natural gas that become
plastic fibers - to produce and ship millions of square

596
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:52,659
yards of carpets to clients who,
a decade later, inevitably trash them in landfills.

597
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:58,039
He set himself a goal, that in the
Story of More, would sound crazy:

598
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:01,042
To bring the production process into a “closed loop” –


599
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:06,101
no longer taking anything
from the earth but only recycle existing material.

600
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:12,060
And to do that without polluting in any way.
It unleashed a whole wave of innovations.

601
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,230
They redesigned their products and their machines.


602
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,619
They began leasing their
carpets, instead of selling them.

603
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:22,859
So that when the time comes to replace
the carpet, they can recuperate the tiles and

604
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:24,700
recycle all of the materials.


605
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,950
They switched the entire
production process to solar power.

606
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,730
Sadly, Anderson died a few years ago.


607
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:36,310
But today, his company is well and
on its way to meet his crazy goal: Shifting from

608
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:42,041
a linear to a circular, closed-loop production,
something that at first was unimaginable.

609
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:47,005
Interface is still the global
market leader, and they are highly profitable.

610
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:52,010
And as you can imagine,
their workforce is incredibly proud to work there.

611
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:58,740
Interface is now setting itself its
next big goal - not just to be carbon neutral, but

612
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,480
to become “carbon negative”.


613
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,780
You know, remember how with regenerative
farming, plants, you know, can draw down carbon from

614
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,090
the atmosphere and store it in the ground?


615
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:14,250
Well, with plant-based fibers, you know,
Interface is starting to store that carbon in the carpets.

616
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,590
And Ray was ahead of his time.


617
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:22,040
He happened to be in carpets,
but really any company can choose to do this.

618
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,835
Imagine your workplace doing something similar.


619
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:31,007
Like I don't know for you but
I would feel so motivated and so energized.

620
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:34,010
And wow so proud!


621
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:37,013
So that’s production and consumption.


622
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:41,017
And to round this out let’s talk about
the new story of energy.

623
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:49,651
Decades of technological innovation
have made wind and solar so cheap that in many places

624
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:55,031
it’s now cheaper than coal,
oil and gas and will soon be much cheaper.

625
00:42:57,033 --> 00:43:01,099
Even without climate change, we would still
be moving away from fossil fuels simply because

626
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:04,040
we have better, cleaner technology now.


627
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:08,981
Electric cars are about to get much
cheaper, than traditional cars too and they are much

628
00:43:08,981 --> 00:43:12,006
more fun to drive.


629
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,180
Of course, the stuff that goes into wind and
solar panels and electric cars still has to be dug

630
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:21,059
from the ground, like oil and gas
- so it’s not perfect.

631
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:25,150
But it’s still key to stop warming
the planet and give us a liveable future.

632
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:31,442
It’s also important to remember that
renewable energy is just a technology, not a silver bullet.

633
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:36,820
There’s a risk we fall into the old story
- create ever more demand to make ever more

634
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,034
profits, and destroy
ecosystems along the way.

635
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:45,530
We need to be efficient about the resources
we use, and not simply go crazy digging up

636
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:48,569
all the lithium in the
world just because we can.

637
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:53,423
Let’s only put up the solar panels
and wind turbines we need, not more.

638
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:58,011
And let’s use them to benefit our communities.


639
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:03,119
Because with renewables, we can produce
energy on our roofs, store it in batteries, and create

640
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,290
micro-grids with the neighbors.


641
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:10,023
The money stays in the local
economy, and we become more self-reliant.

642
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:15,028
Oil and gas created good jobs for many years,


643
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:18,656
but renewables will create a whole lot more of them!


644
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:24,480
Already now, solar panel installer and wind
turbine technician are among the fastest growing

645
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,039
job categories.


646
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:30,900
And we’ll need plenty of people to install
batteries, heat pumps, and car charging stations.

647
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:36,170
We’ll see lots of work return to
local communities that had been bleeding jobs.

648
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,300
Let’s zoom out.


649
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:46,020
Everywhere, in food, in consumption,
production energy and other areas too, a new story,

650
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,079
a better story is emerging and gaining steam.


651
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:51,109
And sometimes rapidly.


652
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:54,710
But the million dollar question is:
can this be enough?

653
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:59,600
Let’s assume we do all this,
can we turn the ship around?

654
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:06,970
In 2014, a group of 200 scientists and
specialists put together a list of all the big ideas on

655
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,690
how to stop climate breakdown.


656
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:13,290
They mainly focused on carbon,
but many of their solutions also provide breakthroughs

657
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:17,430
in stabilizing ecosystems and reducing pollution.


658
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:21,010
This effort is called "Project Drawdown".


659
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:25,200
They came up with a list of 80 items -
with things we’ve talked about like upgrading

660
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,019
the way we grow food, replanting
forests, and switching to renewable energy.

661
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:33,160
But also other things,
some of them quite surprising.

662
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,450
For example recycling greenhouse gasses
in air conditioning units, which turns out to

663
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:38,559
be a big deal.


664
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:43,460
They asked the question: What happens
if we were to take all our existing solutions and

665
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:48,300
scale them up… would this be
enough to stop the world from getting too warm?

666
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,690
Or do we fall short? The answer is…


667
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:57,670
Yes, it could be enough, if we manage
to implement all the major solutions we have at hand.

668
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:01,970
Actually, once we get to a point where we
stop the warming, in principle, we could even

669
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,710
go into reverse.


670
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:07,640
We could draw carbon back down from the
atmosphere and turn the thermostat back down.

671
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:12,019
That’s why they called their research “Drawdown”.


672
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:16,023
If you're interested in more,
you can check out the book they published about it.

673
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,300
The other question they asked is,
how much is all of this going to cost?

674
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:27,110
The answer is quite astonishing: yes,
at first we’ll have to invest a lot, but within 30

675
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:29,910
years it will pay back
three times what it costs.

676
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,570
In fact, and this blows my mind.


677
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:37,400
Like we can pay for all of the investments
to get to a hundred percent renewable energy

678
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,309
just from the saving on healthcare,
because we won't have all of the diseases from air

679
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:44,010
pollution anymore.


680
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,530
And if you're interested, you can
read up on all this research with the links we've

681
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,932
put on online on The Week's website.


682
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:56,670
When I first started learning about this,
I thought that the goal was to do less harm

683
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:59,290
and stop destroying our planet.


684
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:05,910
But now I understand that we can be
much more ambitious: we can go into reverse and heal

685
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,990
a lot of the damage we’ve done.


686
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:11,540
And that to me, is so much more motivating.


687
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:17,930
So if we start to invest massively
like really seriously right now, like now, now.

688
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:22,632
Then we'll see some of the
benefits right away, like cleaner air.

689
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:28,450
And there could be a big, big sigh of relief
by 2050, because we'll have passed the danger

690
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:31,060
zone and start to draw down.


691
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:35,190
So from a purely technical
perspective, it could be done.

692
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:39,510
But let's face it, like it will
take tremendous energy and determination.

693
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:44,290
We have to implement something like
80 solutions, you know, at the same time on a huge scale,

694
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,950
worldwide.


695
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:52,710
And for those of us who live in the big
economies, like the US and Europe and China, like

696
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:57,250
we must lead the way like this is a
massive effort that will require absolute dedication.

697
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:06,280
And I sometimes I wonder
if we have this in us to do something of this scale.

698
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,220
But then we learnt that in the past, we’ve
been able to pull off some impressive infrastructure

699
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,320
upgrades, and we’ve
done it more than a few times.

700
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:20,740
So if we’ve been able to do it before, it
would be unconscionable not to try it now.

701
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:27,238
In the 19th century, when cities
became more and more crowded,

702
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:30,710
diseases like cholera swept through them.


703
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,030
It killed thousands and thousands of people.


704
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:37,319
When a doctor figured out
it was coming from human waste, every…

705
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:43,119
single… street in London, in NY, in every
city was cut open to install the gigantic

706
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,007
sewer system we still use today.


707
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,990
This would be a huge endeavor in our time.


708
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:54,730
Imagine what it was then, all by hand,
long before mechanical excavators!

709
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:59,490
Or take this example:
This is a street in New York in 1904.

710
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:02,440
You know what urbanists’
biggest headache was back then?

711
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,120
Horse poop.


712
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:11,032
There were places in New York where
manure was piled up 20 feet high, that’s 6 meters!

713
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:15,310
Expert commissions made
grand  plans to deal with the issue.

714
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,663
And then this happened.


715
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,667
This is New York just 9 years later.


716
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:24,628
The same happened with electricity.


717
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:30,009
In Europe and the US, we electrified
our cities and then, in just a decade or two,

718
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,219
the whole continent.


719
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,369
We are capable of amazing transformations.


720
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:40,436
During World War II, the US
achieved incredible feats even faster.

721
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:46,025
Just 2 years after Pearl Harbor,
the US was producing a plane every 4 minutes.

722
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,559
And two military ships every day.


723
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:54,033
The whole economy was rewired,
new technologies were developed.

724
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:58,037
This set the basis for the
post-war middle-class boom.

725
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:03,260
We are capable of almost
unbelievable things, when we put our minds to it.

726
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:06,212
We’ve done it before.


727
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:12,300
More recently, China, in record time, built
an extraordinary network of high-speed trains.

728
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:20,020
23.000 miles or 37,000 km,
in just 12 years, that connect all the major cities.

729
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:23,646
It connected the country in a whole new way.


730
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,530
In other words, like we could do this,
you know, if we decide collectively to do so.


731
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:30,730
And, my god, it will be worth it!


732
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:35,390
You know,, for years and years, we’ve
been told that in order to “save the planet”,

733
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:39,430
we'll have to sacrifice.
Like the good days are over.

734
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:42,720
Well… more and more,
we feel it might be just the opposite.

735
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:48,060
Our lives can actually become richer with
a better food system, and stronger communities,

736
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:50,000
and a healthier energy system.


737
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:59,770
There's a sense that in order to end the climate
crisis, we have to live in huts with no electricity

738
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:03,450
[laughing] and eat spinach for dinner.


739
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:08,260
I think that's what people think it is, but
actually I think climate action is a chance

740
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:12,230
to completely upscale or make everything better.


741
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,230
Sure.


742
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:17,329
You know, the transition will certainly be
super difficult at times, but when was that

743
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:20,035
ever reason to shy away from a challenge?


744
00:51:20,329 --> 00:51:24,060
Because ultimately we have
more to gain than to lose, right?

745
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:29,141
For us, that was sort of a major shift,
in our thinking.you know, even

746
00:51:29,141 --> 00:51:33,880
if these crisis magically disappeared, you
know, we'd still want to do all of those things

747
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,011
that we talked about because
they will make our lives so much better.

748
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:45,644
Reorienting around a sustainable society


749
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:50,500
could make people happier
than they've been in my generation.

750
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:55,410
So I do hope it's time
for a new, a new human story.

751
00:51:55,410 --> 00:52:01,960
That's less about domination and
extraction and more about cooperation and sharing.

752
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,609
It’s people doing farming, you know it’s
people growing things, it’s people going

753
00:52:06,609 --> 00:52:08,990
back into arts and doing all these other things.


754
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:14,430
It’s beautiful, it’s like a really
a renaissance happening right here in the

755
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:15,430
middle of chaos.


756
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,009
And it’s beautiful.


757
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:24,819
You know, with all the superhero movies
in our culture, we’ve sort of bought the idea

758
00:52:24,819 --> 00:52:29,970
that it takes a chosen
one with super powers to save us.

759
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:34,570
So we wait for someone
our political leaders to do something.

760
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:39,780
But in real life, that’s not
how profound change ever came about.

761
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:45,790
In real life, it happens when
we reach a critical mass and then things shift.

762
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,690
That’s almost mathematical.


763
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,900
And that’s the part I find exciting!


764
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:57,540
Because it means I am needed, that you are
needed and that we can all contribute something.

765
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:03,000
So if what excites you is innovation,
well that’s awesome because we need that!

766
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,950
And if you are into recreating
communities and a society that’s more fair, well again

767
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:11,647
perfect because we need that too.


768
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:16,920
Or if you are into common sense and
what’s good about traditional ways, we need that

769
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:22,032
as well so that we shape a
better future with the best of the past.

770
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:28,664
You know, when you look back at history,
some generations get thrown an incredible challenge.

771
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:36,230
Freedom and self rule after thousands of
years of monarchy, ending slavery and legal segregation,

772
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:41,300
women gaining the right to vote, defeating
fascism in Europe, bringing down communist

773
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,589
dictatorships.


774
00:53:42,589 --> 00:53:48,819
Well, for all of us alive today,
this is our challenge, our adventure.

775
00:53:48,819 --> 00:53:53,150
We must upgrade our energy systems
and our agricultural industrial systems.

776
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:56,839
We must protect them and
expand the remaining wild ecosystems.

777
00:53:56,839 --> 00:54:00,520
And we must do all this at once.


778
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,760
Like it’s World War II mobilization on steroids.


779
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:11,310
Yes, and sometimes it looks like things
are not moving nearly fast enough, and we feel

780
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:12,450
depressed.


781
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:18,540
But then I remember, it felt just as impossible
to people in the past before a massive shift

782
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,540
happened.


783
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,910
It always does.


784
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:25,369
But just imagine we make
this happen, the energy we’ll feel.

785
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:27,430
I know that I want to roll up my sleeves.


786
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,339
I have to be part of this.


787
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:32,930
And how this will play out
exactly, no one knows yet.

788
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:37,270
In our group, some of us are excited about
the role of new technologies, while others

789
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:42,029
are more excited about social
movements or simplifying their lives.

790
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:47,440
Some of us believe that to make this transition,
governments must step up big times, but others

791
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,109
think that personal
responsibility will be key.

792
00:54:50,109 --> 00:54:55,710
And in your own group, you might also have
different perspectives on some of these topics.

793
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:56,710
And that's OK!


794
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:02,007
That’s probably even a good thing,
because we need to come at this from all angles.

795
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:06,011
And we started this
episode with the question: Is there hope?

796
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:10,641
And our situation reminds
me of a friend of mine, you know,

797
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:13,018
who was told that she had cancer.


798
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:17,960
And I remembered that at first she just
kept asking her doctor, you know: "Please tell me,

799
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,649
will I make it?"


800
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:19,024
Yeah.


801
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:23,470
And then she realized like, whatever
the doctor would say, it wouldn't ultimately

802
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:27,449
matter because she was gonna
do whatever it would take, regardless.

803
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,452
This was now her fight, you know, her adventure.


804
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:33,720
And i’m glad to say she survived.


805
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,001
What we learned from her is that,
in the end, it’s not about hope from the outside –

806
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,349
say a doctor or a climate expert.


807
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:43,632
It’s about the fire we have in our belly.


808
00:55:45,369 --> 00:55:47,059
And that's what we'll talk about next time.


809
00:55:47,059 --> 00:55:50,639
In the third and final time
together, we'll delve into the question,

810
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,850
what can I do? What can we do?


811
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,520
You know, what would give us joy?


812
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:58,021
You know, what would really
make us proud, but that's for day three.

813
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:58,647
Yeah.


814
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:03,271
Because now, it's time again for the
most important part – the conversation in your group

815
00:56:03,271 --> 00:56:05,190
just like you did on day 1.


816
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:10,480
Because it's hard to
process a topic as mighty as this one alone.

817
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,036
So we need each
other to make sense of it all.

818
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,037
Yeah.


819
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:18,041
So we wish you a great conversation and we'll
see you in a minute to kick off that conversation.

820
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:18,541
Bye.
